$V_{long}$ = $PV_t [F_t - F_o]$
Value to the long would be the PV of the increase of the "Price". 
- For short it would be the opposite. 
## Value with no carrying cost/benefits 

$$
V_{long} = S_t - \frac{F_0}{(1 + r_f)^{T-t}} 
$$

## Value with carrying costs/benefits. 
$$
V_{long} = (F_t - F_0) / (1 + r_f)^{T-t}
$$
- Here the present value won't be the spot price, as it also includes the carrying costs or benefits.
