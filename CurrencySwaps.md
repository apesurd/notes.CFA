Actual exchange happens at the initiation and at the expiration of the swap. 

Types of swaps: 
1. Floating for floating 
2. Fixed for floating 
3. Fixed for fixed 

In the curriculum only fixed-for-fixed is discussed. 
We calculate the coupon just like we did for [[InterestRateSwaps]] . 
	for both the currencies. 
That would give us the price in the contract. 

To determine the price. We calculate the present value for the coupon payments and take the difference.
