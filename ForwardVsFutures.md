## Forwards 
- Custom agreement between long and short
- Counter-party risk 
- Non-standard contracts 
- Unregulated 

## Futures 
- Clearinghouse is the counter-party. Enforces margin requirements. 
- Pricing of the futures are similarly calculated as forward contract. 
- Minimal counter party risk is involved as the contracts are marked to market at the end of each day. Which makes the value of the contract 0 at the end of each day. 
- No counterparty risk. 
- Standard contract 
- Regulated.
