1. When yield curve flattens or inverts. 
   Short term IR are higher than LT rates, banks with short dated liabilities would need to pay higher interest while receiving lower interest on long dated loans. This would lead to decrease in banks net interest income.  

2. Even if the maturity matches, any change in the yield curve would affect bank's net interest income, by the virtue of the size of assets in comparison to liabilities.
   - If IR fall in general, the decrease in interest received from the loans would be higher than the decrease in the interest paid to the depositors. leading to decrease in net interest income. 
     
3. Difference in repricing frequency (given IR falls in general) 
   if interest rates for assets are repriced more frequently than liabilities, that would leads to faster drop in interest receipt in comparison to slower drop in interest payment.
