#FSA #employeeCompensation 

- Funded status is reported on **Balance Sheet**. 
- Periodic Pension Cost (PnL) are reported on **Income Statement**.
	  - [[GAAP]] single item under operating expense. 
	  - [[IFRS]] components can be declared under separate line items. 
- In **Cash Flow statements**, Contributions are classified as CFO (outflow)
- **Notes**: TPPC and plan assumptions are reported. 

Analysts need to be aware of the possible distortions of financial results and ratios. 
	So need to make adjustments whenever making comparative financial analysis. 

## Plan assumptions 
- Check where discount rate stands wrt the industry avg, since higher discount rate would reduce the liability of the company. 
- All plan assumptions should be internally consistent. 
	- Discount rate and salary growth rate should reflect the consistent view of inflation. 
	- Expected return ([[GAAP]]) should reflect plan's asset allocation. 

## Funded status reporting 
As with other forms of net asset/liability reporting, this may not reflect a clear picture especially when size of asset/liability is significant wrt the rest of the company.
- Company can have low debt-to-asset ratio, in net in comparison to gross reporting. 

## Differences in IS due to standards used 
Need to make adjustments to ensure uniform treatments of components. 
For e.g. Past Service cost needs to be shifted from OCI to IS, when comparing to an IS reported under IFRS. 

## Classification of operating vs non-operating expense 
Ideally actual return is non-operating income and interest cost is a non-operating expense, but due to oneline consolidation under [[GAAP]], a single operating expense is reported in IS (which takes into account both actual return and interest cost )

To better reflect the company's operating performance: 
1. Add PPC and subtract current service cost from the reported PPC. 
2. Add actual return to non-operating income 
3. Add income cost to non-operating expense. 

As a result operating income and income before tax can change. 

## Cash flow 
- Contributions is the amt which the company pays for the pension fund. 
- TPPC is the amount which a company should contribute this period to maintain the funded status. 
- The excess or shortfall (which is the change in funded status) can be considered as a financial activity where the company is borrowing from the pension fund. 

All the contribution in classified as CFO under [[GAAP]] (also allowed in IFRS)
In essence: 
1. Add the change in funded status back to CFO 
2. Reduce the change in funded status from CFF. 

Total cash flow after this adjustment should remain the same.
