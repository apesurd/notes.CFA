Time elapsed between the occurrence of an event and subsequent action that depends on that event. 

Low latency traders need to beat the competition to: 
1. Take order ( at best prices)
2. Make the market. 
3. Canceling standing orders. 


The time gap can be divided into 3 sub-gaps: 
1. News -> Receipt 
2. Receipt -> Decision 
3. Decision -> Order received 

#1 and #3 related to communication speed, whereas #2 related to the computing speed. 

Traders requiring lower latency prefer *LINE OF SIGHT MICROWAVE* channels as they are faster then traditional FIBRE-OPTIC or COPPER channels. 
Speed can also be made faster if distance travelled by data-link is minimised. For this reason traders set up their server near to the exchange. 
Some exchanges also allow traders to co-locate their servers inside the exchange for a fee. 
Also subscribe to hi-speed data feed from vendors

## Optimising computing 
1. Processing hardware overclocked using liquid cooling 
2. Using multiprocessors 
3. fast memory as opposed to hard drive 

1. Using assembly languages for frequently executed functions. 
2. C++ as "Backbone"
3. Python for trading rules (which require frequent changes)

Predetermined actions, by running wide variety of scenarios ahead of time. 
Optimal decision for each scenario is pre-determined, avoiding delays once the scenario is actually observed.
