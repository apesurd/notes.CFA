#FSA #employeeCompensation 

Firm promises to pay the employee after retirement.

Promised benefit is based on: 
1. Employee's years of service. 
2. Final compensation 
3. Benefit factor. 

Unlike [[DefinedContributionPlan]] employee is not concerned about the investment decisions. 
Employee takes the pension system as a black box.

Employer assumes all the investment risk. 
Employer is responsible for making contributions and investment decisions 
- Need to make sure that there are sufficient pension assets to pay out the promised benefits when they are due. 

Most firms set up a Trust Fund to manage the pension assets. 
- The Fund is responsible for making investment decisions such that the promised obligations are fulfilled. 
- Employer is responsible for making regular contribution to the trust fund. 

## Financial Reporting 
- Employer must estimate the value of the future promised amount. 
	- Years of service and final compensation can only be estimated. 
- Other estimates include: 
	- Employee turnover 
	- Avg. retirement age 
	- Mortality rate 
	- Discount rate 
- On the other hand, we have the fair value of the pension assets. 

If fair value of the pension assets is greater than PV of the pension obligations, 
	- the plan is said to be overfunded
	- On BS, recorded as "Net pension asset". 
 
If fair value of the pension assets is less than PV of the pension obligations, 
	- the plan is said to be underfunded
	- On BS, recorded as "Net pension liability".
