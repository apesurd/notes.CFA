## Regulatory Interdependence
Fundamentally, Regulators are meant to protect the interest of general public by imposing rules and standards on entities whose actions can impact interest of general public.

See [[RegulatoryCapture]]

See [[RegulatoryCompetition]]

See [[RegulatoryArbitrage]]

A Global Cohesive Regulatory Framework, i.e. cooperation on global level, is necessary to avoid [[RegulatoryArbitrage]] and [[RegulatoryCompetition]]

Within the same country there might be conflicts in the objectives of different regulatory bodies leading to inconsistent overall regulatory framework.

## Regulatory Tools
### Price Mechanisms
to influence behaviour
e.g. Subsidies(fuel efficient vehicles) and taxes (sin tax on alcohol.)

### Restrict/Require certain activities
more direct tool
- ban on sale/consumption of harmful drugs.
- requirement to file quarterly financial statements

### Provide public goods / Finance Private Projects
- to reduce society's carbon footprint, govt. can provide clean energy and provide loans/support for companies to clean up manufacturing lines.


- Effectiveness of the tools depend on the enforcement abilities of the regulators.
- Furthermore, the tools should have the deterrent effect on regulated entities.


Enforcements/Sanctions should be placed on the executives who committed the violations not the company itself, as it may end up hurting the shareholders/Investors.
