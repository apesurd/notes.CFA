## Market Manipulation 
Activity that produces false or misleading market data. 
- Cause other traders to act to the advantage of the manipulators. 
ILLEGAL, but difficult to separate manipulative trades from genuine ones. 

#### Trading for market impact 
Raise or lower prices deliberately, to create an impression of the value of the company. 

#### Rumourmongering
ILLEGAL in several jurisdictions. 
But it's legal to post an opinion. 

Analyst should make sure that the information is balanced and based on facts. 

#### Wash trading 
Trading between the accounts controlled by the same entity, to create a false impression about the liquidity and market activity of the security. 

#### Spoofing / Layering 
Fake limit orders to create false optimism/pessimism about the security.  

#### Bluffing
Preying on the momentum traders which follow market trends. 
- Post orders to establish market trend. 
- And then trade in reverse once momentum traders have followed the trend. 

e.g. Pump and dump, "short and distort"

#### Gunning the Market. 
Force other traders to make disadvantageous trades. 

eg. Leading to decline in the price of the security after overly shorting it, and buy it when stop loss orders are executed. 

#### Squeezing and cornering
- Obtain control over resources needed to settle contracts. 
- Abruptly withdraw the resources, triggering defaults by traders. 
- Profits by providing resources at high prices. 

Short Squeeze: 
1. Buy majority of assets from the market. 
2. Lend it to unsuspecting shorts. 
3. Demand it back when the price rises. 
4. Due to insufficient supply, buying these from the market is even costlier, leading to increase in price. 
5. Initial buyers can then sell it back to the market at higher prices. 

Cornering: 
1.   Get into the long side of a commodity future and buy majority of the underlying. 
2. At the time of expiration, demand the physical delivery of the goods, which are scares in the market, leading to increase in the spot price. 
3. Sell commodities at higher prices. 

It's illegal and prohibited by most future exchanges, Enforcement is difficult however as it is gamed by the manipulators.
