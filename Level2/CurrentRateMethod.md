## Highlights
1. All BS accounts: [[CurrentRate_MA]]  (as it's a point in time measure)
	- Except common stock : [[HistoricalRate_MA]] 
	- And retained earnings: $RE_{end} = RE_{bgn} + NI - Div$
2. All IS items: [[AverageRate_MA]]  (Since it's not point in time)
3. Dividends declared: [[HistoricalRate_MA]] 
4. [[CTA]] to balance accounting equation, change in CTA as FX gain/loss is recorded in OCI

## Effect on ratios after [[Translation_MA]] 
- Pure ratios^[where numerator and denominator both either belong to IS or to BS] won't be affected, since the same rate is used for translation. i.e. [[CurrentRate_MA]] for BS items and [[AverageRate_MA]] for IS items. 
- For mixed ratios, where numerator is from IS and denominator is from BS, and the underlying currency is appreciating, then mixed ratios after translation would be lower, since [[CurrentRate_MA]] would be higher than [[AverageRate_MA]]. 
- The opposite would be true for the reverse mixed ratio, when the underlying currency is depreciating. (currency depreciation implies decrease in FX rates.)
