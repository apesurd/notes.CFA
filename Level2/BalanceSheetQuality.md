High quality balance sheet is evidenced by: 
## Completeness 
- Related to off-balance sheet liabilities 
	- "take-or-pay" purchase contracts; obligation to take delivery of goods or pay a specified amount. 
	- This amount should be reinstated in the balance sheet for analysis 

- In equity methods, since one-line consolidation is done the information is incomplete. 
	- Liabilities of associate is not recorded. 
	- Profitability ratios (e.g. ROA) are higher due to smaller asset base

## Unbiased measurement 
- Particularly important for assets and liabilities for which valuation is subjective. 
- Examples include: 
	- Investment in debt/equity of other companies, where market value is not available. 
	- Goodwill, value and timing of impairment is subjective. 
	- Inventory, subjectivity in testing for impairment 
	- Pension liabilities, based on actuarial assumptions. 
- Firms would try to overstate assets, or understate liabilities to overstate equity (i.e. increase in earnings)
## Clear Presentation 
Management has discretion in determining which line items should be shown separately and which should be aggregated into a single total. 

- For inventory analyst can consult inventory notes to know how the inventory is being carried over.
