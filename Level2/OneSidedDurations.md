#fixedIncome #bondsWithEmbeddedOptions 

For bonds with embedded options, price change corresponding to increase and decrease in the yield curve can be significantly different, if it's near or at the money. 
One sided duration, captures the duration change on at one side of the yield curve. 

## Putables 
Price change would be more if yield curve shifts downward (i.e. IR decreases), as that would induce more IR risk. 

## Callables
Price change would be more if yield curve shifts upward (i.e. IR increases) , inducing more IR risk. 


>[!Tip] Remember the shape of the curves (Price vs yield) to get an idea which side move more.
