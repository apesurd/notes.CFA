#Economics 

One common form of  [[ProductionFunction]]

$$
Y = TK^{\alpha}L^{1-\alpha}
$$
	where Y: Aggregate Economic Output
				T: Total factor productivity
				K: Amount of capital available
				L: Size of labour force


$$
\frac{Y}{L} = T (\frac{K}{L})^\alpha
$$


Properties: 
1. **Constant returns to scale**: If K and L increase by same % the change in aggregate output would be the same.
2.   Diminishing marginal productivity: More [[CapitalDeepening]] lead to lower and lower improvement in output per worker. 
	1. Developing nations see more output per worker for the same amount of capital deepening. 
	2. Improvement in technology can help shift the productivity curve up.
	3. After a certain point Profit Maximising Producer would stop adding more capital as marginal cost of capital == marginal product of capital

Economists generally are more into growth rates: 
[[SolowsApproach]] represents the above equation is terms of changes in the factors
