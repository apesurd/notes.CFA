[[GordonGrowthModel]] can be rearranged to the following form 
ASSUMPTION: Consistent payout/retention.
## Justified *trailing* P/E ratio
$$ 
 \begin{split} 
 P_0 / E_0 &= \frac{D_0 / E_0 (1+g)}{r -g}  \\ 
 P_0 / E_0 &= \frac{(1-b)(1+g)}{r -g}  \\ 
 \end{split} 
$$



## Justified *leading* P/E ratio
$$ 
 \begin{split} 
 P_0 / E_1 &= \frac{D_1 / E_1}{r -g}  \\ 
 P_0 / E_1 &= \frac{(1-b)}{r -g}  \\ 
 \end{split} 
$$

Also: 
> [!Note]
> Justified trailing PE ratio = Justified leading PE ratio * $(1+g)$
