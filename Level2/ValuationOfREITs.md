Can be valued using the following three approaches. 
## Discounted Cash flow 
- Similar to Dividend discount model (single and multistage model)
- Discount (for the next term) from REITs is used for valuation. 

- Calculates absolute value based on expected dividend and div. growth rate. 
## Net Asset Valuation 
- NAV = market value of total assets - value of total liabilities^[Can be book value if not very different form book value.]. 
	- We use market value, since book value is often understated due to speedy depreciation. 

> [!Note]
> Dividends or FFO do not capture the value of land and vacant properties as they do not produce income. But NAV takes these into account. 

- If value of any RE property is missing, we can use Direct Capitalisation (see [[RealEstateValuation]]) to estimate its value. 
$$
NOI_1 / \text{Cap rate}
$$
here: 
	Cap rate: is market-required rate of return.
	Non-cash rents = Straight-rent^[Average rent over the term of a lease contract] - Cash rent received 
	Adjusted $NOI_0$ = 
		$NOI_0$ 
		- Non-cash rents 
		+ Adjustments for new acquisitions 
	$NOI_1$ = 
		Adjusted $NOI_0$
		+ Expected growth 

- Value of Cash and receivables, land and property under development is also considered in the calculation of NAV. 
	- Goodwill and intangibles (like Deferred Tax Assets) are not considered. 

- Using NAV and number of outstanding shares, we can calculated NAVPS. 
	- If NAVPS is higher then the share price, then one can say that market is optimistic about the the REIT. 
	- (NAVPS > Share price) can be attributed to good management track record, low leverage, and good corporate governance. 

- NAV is an absolute measure
- P / NAV is a form of relative valuation.



## Relative Valuation 
- Similar to price multiple method for equities. 
- Ratios used are P / FFO^[Funds From Operations] and P / AFFO^[Adjusted Flow From Operations] 
- Relative valuation based on sector avg. multiples. 
- P / FFO and P / AFFO multiples are globally accepted standard in evaluating [[REITS]]


> [!Note]
> Leverage is not accounted for either of the above 2 price multiples.

### FFO calculation 

FFO (Continuing Operating Performance) = 
	Net Income 
	+ Depreciation / Amortisation 
	- Gains from property sales 
	+ Loss from property sales 

Rationale: 
	1. We want to remove non-recurring items from net income. 
	2. Add back depreciation as real tend to retain value / appreciate over time. 
	3. Gains/ losses do not represent sustainable/recurring income. 

- Used more frequently, as readily available 
### AFFO calculation 
AFFO (better measure of economic income) = 
	FFO 
	- Non-cash rent (Straight-rent - Cash rent received)
	- Maintenance-type capex.

- AFFO accounts for the expenditures required to sustain the property's economic income 
- It's a better measure but not readily available, so requires subjective estimate
