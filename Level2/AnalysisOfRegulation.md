## Cost-Benefit Analysis of Regulation
Prior to the issuance, the proposed regulatory framework should be assessed in terms of its cost relative to the benefit it provides.
- From the perspective of the regulator.
- Study of COST to industry
- Against effectiveness in achieving regulatory objectives

- General costs and benefits might be clear, but the full impact might be difficult to quantify.

Besides the *Implementation cost* (i.e. operating cost of the regulator),  [[RegulatoryBurden]] also needs to be considered, which is harder to quantify.

Some of the costs associated with a regulation may be unintended, e.g. Unanticipated implementation costs. 
There could also be indirect costs, due to unintended consequences. Indirect costs often can't be fully accounted for.

In summary, regulatory costs and benefits are difficult to assess before the regulation is in place, that is why some of the regulations include a [[SunsetClause]]

## Effect of Regulation on Valuation
Analysis from the perspective of investors of regulated entities.
Not only consider the immediate impact, but also the impact on the future prospects of the affected companies and industries. 

Using Valuation tools make investment recommendations

Steps to guide through the analytical process:
1. Assess the likelihood of implementation
	1. Regulator's intentions
	2. Cost-Benefit analysis framework
	3. Extent of engagement with regulated parties.
	4. Public and political pressure
2. Impact on revenue
	   Not all entities would be affected equally.
	1. Price limits, tariffs, additional fees
	2. Ban on sales
	3. Product warnings
	4. Pricing transparency, detailed break-down of fees
	5. Utility companies have earnings capped
4. Impact on cost
	   Can cost be passed on to consumers, analyse competitive position of industry
	1. Improved safety measures for employees
	2. Additional equipment required
	3. Required to use costlier raw materials to protect consumer safety
4. Business risk
	   Harder to quantify the impact on cash-flow, difficult to forecast and thus assign probability to events and reflect such risks in discount rate.
	1. Fines
	2. Compensate customers
	3. Ban on activities
