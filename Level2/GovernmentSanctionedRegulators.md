Can be either:
1. Govt. bodies, e.g. SEC
2. Independent regulators, deriving power/authority from the govt.

Have the legal authority to enact/enforce regulations on the bodies within the parameters of the mandates given to them. 
The rules issues by govt. regulators are called **Administrative Regulations**.

Legislative body (US Congress) Enact broad-level [[Statutes]] for GSRs

Courts interpret laws, define permitted/forbidden practices and impose penalties. 
Interpretation of Court is called **Judicial Law**


### Independent Regulators
- Not funded by the govt.
- Politically independent.
- e.g. PCOAB (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board) established by US Congress to oversee audits of public companies. 
	  It's funded by annual fees paid by public companies, brokers and dealers.
