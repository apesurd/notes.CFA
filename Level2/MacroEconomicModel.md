#multiFactorModels #portfolioManagement 

A type of [[MultifactorModels]] where factors are surprises in the macro economic variables, like interest rates, inflation, business cycle, credit spread etc. 

Factor surprises are defined as the difference b/w realised value and expected value of the factor. 

$$
E(R) = E + \beta_{GDP} \;  F_{GDP} +  \beta_{INF} \;  F_{INF}
$$
	where $F_x$ is the surprise. i.e. $actual - expected$ , 
		the expected value of $F_x$ is 0. 
		E represents the value of the asset if everything works as expected, i.e. there are no 
			surprises. or Asset's expected return.  

- Regression is performed to estimate the value of sensitivities with factor surprises as dependent variables.
