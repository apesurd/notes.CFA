#issCorp #AnalysisOfDividendsAndRepurchase 

Probability of dividends continuing at the current rate for a company. 

## How to analyse 
- Traditional way for looking at it using [[DividendPayoutRatio]] or [[DividendCoverageRatio]]
	- The numbers are then compared with the industry average of the market within which the company operates. 
	- If [[DividendPayoutRatio]] is higher then industry average, suggests a higher probability of the dividend cut and lower level of dividend safety. 

- Another way is to analyse [[FCFECoverageRatio]]

## Trends 
- Small young companies pay little to no dividend, preferring to reinvest interanlly for growth . 
	- Their payout ratio tend to increase over time. 

- Large mature companies usually have a payout ratio in the range of 40% to 60%.

- In making a qualitative judgement about a company. 
	- Stable / increasing dividends are looked upon favourably, 
	- Cut down dividends in the past are looked upon unfavourably.
