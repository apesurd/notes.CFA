Economic theory that *Regulators* may come to be dominated by the interests of the 
*Regulated Entities* rather than *public interest*. 

## Possible explanations
1. One reason could be that regulated entities are more motivated to influence the regulators than general public.
2. Members of the regulatory authority come from a pool of industry experts, leading to conflict of interest.

This problem is more common with SROs as they are more likely to be staffed by industry experts.
