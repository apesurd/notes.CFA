#fixedIncome 

Another form of key rate duration model shaping risk. 
All yield curve changes can be described using the combination of the following three movements: 
1. Level ($x_L$)
2. Curvature ($x_C$)
3. Steepness ($x_S$)

$$
\Delta P/P = - D_L \Delta x_L - D_C \Delta x_C - D_S \Delta x_S
$$
- $D_L$ is equal to the effective duration. 
- In general this is the impact of the key movements on the bonds price.
	L > S > C
- Note: All changes have negative effect on the bonds price.
