# Basics of Multiple Regression and Underlying Assumptions 
- describe the types of investment problems addressed by multiple linear regression and the regression process
- formulate a multiple linear regression model, describe the relation between the dependent variable and several independent variables, and interpret estimated regression coefficients
- explain the assumptions underlying a multiple linear regression model and interpret residual plots indicating potential violations of these assumptions
# Evaluating Regression Model Fit and Interpreting Model Results 
- evaluate how well a multiple regression model explains the dependent variable by analyzing ANOVA table results and measures of goodness of fit
- formulate hypotheses on the significance of two or more coefficients in a multiple regression model and interpret the results of the joint hypothesis tests
- calculate and interpret a predicted value for the dependent variable, given the estimated regression model and assumed values for the independent variable
# Model Misspecification 
- describe how model misspecification affects the results of a regression analysis and how to avoid common forms of misspecification
- explain the types of heteroskedasticity and how it affects statistical inference
- explain serial correlation and how it affects statistical inference
- explain multicollinearity and how it affects regression analysis
# Extensions of Multiple Regression 
- describe influence analysis and methods of detecting influential data points
- formulate and interpret a multiple regression model that includes qualitative independent variables

# Time-Series Analysis 
- calculate and evaluate the predicted trend value for a time series, modeled as either a linear trend or a log-linear trend, given the estimated trend coefficients
- describe factors that determine whether a linear or a log-linear trend should be used with a particular time series and evaluate limitations of trend models
- explain the requirement for a time series to be covariance stationary and describe the significance of a series that is not stationary
- describe the structure of an autoregressive (AR) model of order p and calculate one- and two-period-ahead forecasts given the estimated coefficients
- explain how autocorrelations of the residuals can be used to test whether the autoregressive model fits the time series
- explain mean reversion and calculate a mean-reverting level
- contrast in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts and compare the forecasting accuracy of different time-series models based on the root mean squared error criterion
- explain the instability of coefficients of time-series models
- describe characteristics of random walk processes and contrast them to covariance stationary processes
- describe implications of unit roots for time-series analysis, explain when unit roots are likely to occur and how to test for them, and demonstrate how a time series with a unit root can be transformed so it can be analyzed with an AR model
- describe the steps of the unit root test for nonstationarity and explain the relation of the test to autoregressive time-series models
- explain how to test and correct for seasonality in a time-series model and calculate and interpret a forecasted value using an AR model with a seasonal lag
- explain autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and describe how ARCH models can be applied to predict the variance of a time series
- explain how time-series variables should be analyzed for nonstationarity and/or cointegration before use in a linear regression; and
- determine an appropriate time-series model to analyze a given investment problem and justify that choice
