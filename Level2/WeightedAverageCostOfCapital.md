$$
WACC = W_d * r_d * (1 - T) + W_e * r_e 
$$
where 
	- $W_d$ and $W_e$ are weight of debt and equity respectively, which are calculated using market value of the firms debt and equity, provided it doesn't differ significantly from firm's target capital structure. If that happens then target capital structure weight should be used as it reflects the capital structure of the firm going forward. 
	- $r_d$ : Cost of debt (before tax)
	- $r_e$ : Cost of equity 
	- T : Tax on interest payment.
