[[NeoClassicalmodel]] predicts that developing markets experience higher growth rates than developed markets.
Therefore the standard of living of the developing countries will eventually converge with developed countries.

[[NeoClassicalmodel]] predicts 2 types of convergence:
1. [[AbsoluteConvergence]]
2. [[ConditionalConvergence]]

[[ClubConvergence]] is an additional hypothesis.
