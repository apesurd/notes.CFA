# Government Support 
Ideally in capitalist societies, government is not expected to support private companies. Banking sector, however, is an exception due to its systematic importance to the economy. 

Other than providing Deposit insurance to stabilise the sector, the govt., in past, has taken steps to rescue failing banks. 
e.g. [[TroubledAssetReliefProgram]]

Factors to determine the likelihood of a bank getting support: 
1. Size of bank: if the bank is large, it's likely to get support. 
2. Health of the banking system: If overall health is able to absorb failure of an isolated bank, it would imply less government support. 

# Government ownership 
Govt. may choose to own some banks due to strategic importance of having strong banks to promote economic development. 
- Another reason could be to build public's faith in the banking sector. 
- Having govt. support adds another dimension of security for the investor. 

# Bank mission 
Affects the way the bank manages its assets and liabilities. 
- Community banks: primarily serve the needs of the immediate community in which they operate. 
	- Exposed to the underlying risks faced by the primary industry in the community. 
	- Also portfolio might not be well diversified. 

# Corporate culture 
- Affects the propensity of the bank to seek risky investments. 
- A more conservative culture would lead to relative conservative risk taking, while the risk-seeking culture would lead to overly aggressive risk stance. 
- There needs to be some balance. 
- Evaluation of culture: 
	1. Diversity of bank's asset 
	   - i.e. narrow focus -> maybe too aggressive 
       2. Accounting restatements
          - Frequent unjustified restatements may indicate unethical culture 
       3. Management compensation: too closely tied to performance may lead to excessive risk taking. 
       4. Speed of loan loss provisions adjustment; Slow response rate indicate aggressive accounting/risk-taking. 



# General factors 
Applicable to the analysis of any company. 
## Competitive environment 
- Affects a bank's culture and risk-taking behaviour. 
- Regional banks may be content and less likely to take unnecessary risk, which might not be true for the global banks. 
## Off-balance sheet items 
Off-balance sheet assets and liabilities may seriously affect an entity if the underlying risk turns out to be larger than the available resources. 
- Off balance sheet exposures may be opaque or not readily available to analysts. 
- Some derivatives can expose banks to massive risks! 
- Banks should look out for [[SpecialPurposeEntity]] which are not deemed to be a [[VariableInterestEntity]] 
## Segment information 
- Analyst should pay attention to the different lines of business and geographical location the bank operates in. 
- Each segment may be exposed to different risks based on geography or sector. 

## Currency Exposure 
Significant for large global banks which are trading in currencies or holding assets and liabilities in currencies whose value fluctuate. 
- Volatility in the underlying market can have significant effect on the banks earnings.
