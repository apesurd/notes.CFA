#issCorp #AnalysisOfDividendsAndRepurchase 

Dividend policy is the approach it follows in determining the timing and amount it pays to the shareholder. 

## Investment Opportunity 
If the firm is anticipating some positive NPV opportunity in near future, it may want to conserve excess cash to use it. 
- This would reduce the amt. of dividend. 

## Financial flexibility 
Since dividends are sticky. Firms would prefer buying back shares to keep financial flexibility 

## Expected volatility of the future earnings. 
Dividend would be decided on the basis of long term sustainable earnings. 
- so high earnings in a particular period, might not guarantee a high dividend payout. 

## Floatation costs 
When firms issue new shares they have to pay floatation costs to the investment banks. 
- Cost of retained earnings < Cost of new equity. 

- Small firms tend to pay more
- High floatation cost would translate into low dividend payout. 

## Contractual and Legal restrictions 
There might be some restrictions from paying dividends. 
Fro example 
1. Impairment of capital rule: 
	   Dividends paid can't be more than retained earnings. 
2. Debt Covenant
	1. Certain liquidity ratios like, current ratio, coverage ratio, etc needs to be managed before paying out dividends. 

## Tax considerations 
- In countries where tax of dividends is higher than capital tax rate, investors generally avoid high div. stocks. 
- This is not the case for the reverse situation though. 
	- Tax paid only when sold. 
	- cost basis may increase upon death 
	- Presence of tax exempt institutions.
