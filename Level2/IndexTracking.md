Ideally an ETF should closely track the return of it's benchmark index, but in reality there are daily deviations from the benchmark, due to the following reasons: 
- Representative samplling and optimisation: 
	- Not fully replicating index; only hold subset of index securities 
- [[DepositoryReceipts]]
	- May be different prices from underlying shares, (due to different trading hours.)
- Index Changes 
	- ETF may take sometime to update portfolio, due to creation and redemption process. 
- Fund Accounting practices 
	- Timing differences in the calculation of NAV
	- Different exchange rates captured (when valuing foreign holdings)
- Regulatory and tax requirements 
	- Different tax rates for foreign vs domestic investors. 
- Cost offsetting strategies. 
	- Lend shares to short sellers for a fixed interest
	- Foreign [[DividentRecapture]]
- Fees and expenses
	- Reduces funds return relative to the index 
	- most significant contributors to tracking error over the long-term.
		- $Tracking\;Error \approxeq Expense\;Ratio$


[[TrackingError]] is used to measure the deviation of ETFs return from the benchmark index returns.
