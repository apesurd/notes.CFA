# Estimation using 
## Debt securities 
- Calculate the yield to maturity of its publicly traded straight-bond^[without any embedded option] with preferably longest maturity.  
	- If that bond is not frequently traded, then YTM might not be indicative of what the market expects. 
	- In such case, yield of the shorter term bond may be used. 
- If the bond is non-traded, quoted YTM would not be reliable 
	- In such cases, we take it's credit rating into consideration and find publicly traded bonds in the market with the same credit rating. 
		- Cost of debt can, then, be calculated using [[MatrixPricing]] approach
	- If credit rating does not exist, then using interest-coverage ratio or/and debt-to-equity ratio we can estimate the credit rating using a model. 
	- Another way of estimating the rate would be to add risk-free rate to the rate implied by the credit rating. 
## Bank Debt 
Interest rate on a new bank loan will most likely reflect current market conditions and current creditworthiness of the subject company, and hence could be a good estimate for the cost of debt for the company.

# International Considerations  
Two theoretically identical companies in different countries can have different cost of debt due to country-specific factors like: 
- Economic conditions 
- Political risk 
- Exchange rate risk 
- Investor protection laws 

- Country Risk rating is assigned to a country based on all the above factors. 
	- For each class of countries we calculate the median IR risk. 
	- Considering the lowest rating as benchmark, we calculate the country risk premium.  (by subtracting class median from benchmark median)
