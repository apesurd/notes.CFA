Sensitivity of bond's price to changes in specific spot rates. 

- Key rates can be slightly negative too, i.e. bond's price would move in the movement of that key rate.
	- especially with low coupon rates, as they are sensitive to IR changes at maturity (most of their returns are realised close to maturity.)

## Straight bonds
- Bond's maturity date is the most significant contributor to bond's effective duration. 
- If the bond is trading at par, then it's maturity key rate duration would be equal to its effective duration and all other rate durations are zero.  

## Callable bonds 
- Bond's exercise date is the most significant contributor to bond's effective duration, **for bonds with higher coupons**
- All else equal, bonds with lower coupon would be less likely to be called. 
## Putable bonds 
- Bond's exercise date is the most significant contributor to bond's effective duration, **for bonds with lower coupons**
- All else equal, bonds with higher coupon would be less likely to be put.
