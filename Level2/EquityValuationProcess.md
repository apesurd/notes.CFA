## 1. Understand the business 
### Industry structure 
> Attractiveness of the industry and prospects of sustained profitability? 

- Current state of the industry can be analysed using [[Porters5Forces]]. 
- Beside this analyst should also look out for factors likely to affect industry's longer term profitability and growth prospects. 

### Competitive strategy 
> Company's relative competitive position and it's competitive strategy?

Type of competitive strategies: 
1. Cost Leadership 
	- Lower cost producer while offering products comparable to those of other companies. 
2. Product differentiation
	   - Offering Unique products or services that are widely valued by buyers, such that the company can command premium prices. 
3. Focus: 
	1. Seeking a competitive advantage within a target segment of the market. 
	2. Can be Cost-Focus or Differentiation-Focus. 

### Financial statements. 
> Company's execution of strategy and prospects for future execution?

- Past financial reports can be considered to evaluate how management dealt with challenges and adapted to changes in the business condition. 
- Sources of information: 
	- Regulatory filings 
	- Press releases 
	- Investor conference calls 
	- Industry organisation publications 
	- Commercial providers of market intelligence. 
- These documents should be analysed to check if the earnings reported are of high quality or not. (See [[EarningsQuality]])

## 2. Forecast company performance 
- Sales, earnings, dividends, financial position, etc. 
- Broadly can be categorised into 2 types: 
	1. Top-Down approach
	   International/National macroeconomic forecasts 
	     -> Industry forecasts
	     -> Individual company forecasts
	2. Bottom-up approach 
	   Stores -> Divisions -> Conglomerate 
## 3. Select appropriate Valuation model 
- Based on company characteristics and context of the valuation 
- Can be broadly classified into 2 types: 
	1. Absolute: Based on the fundamentals/characteristics 
	   - Discounted Cash flow models 
	   - Asset-based Model : Sum of market value of all assets. 
	1. Relative : Compare valuation ratios with comparable companies. 
	   - Compare P/E ratio with avg industry p/E ratio. 
- Aspects to consider: 
	1. Company characteristics. 
	2. Quality/ Availability of Input Data 
	3. Purpose of Analysis. 
- Using multiple valuation models sheds light on the assumptions and perspective of the analysis. 
- In general company is valued as a single entity, but for a large firm [[SumOfPartValuation]] approach can be used. 
## 4. Convert forecasts to a Valuation  
- Before simply using the model to calculate the value. Analyst needs to perform [[SensitivityAnalysis]] (Contextual or overall) and needs to make [[SituationalAdjustments]]
- Sensitivity Analysis to analyse how changes in input would have effect on the value. 
	- e.g. changes in assumptions on future growth and/or discount rate. 
	- e.g. Impact on valuation if a competitor launch a competing product based on possible competitive response. (i.e. Contextual Sensitivity Analysis)

## 5. Apply Valuation conclusions 
- Investment recommendations, opinion on price of a transaction, and economic merits of a strategic investment. 
- Should be written with the intended consumer in mind. 
	1. [[SellSideAnalysts]] -> Retail and institutional brokerage clients 
	2. [[BuySideAnalysts]] -> Portfolio manager / investment committee 
	3. Analysts at corporations (Identify and value acquisition targets) -> Management and directors. 
	4. Analysts at Vendors (publicly distributed research reports) -> Portfolio managers / other analysts.
