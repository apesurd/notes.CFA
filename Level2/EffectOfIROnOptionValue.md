## IR volatility 
As volatility increases, value of the options would increase as it increases the likelihood of the option to be exercised. 
Vol $\uparrow$  => Putable bond value increases 
Vol $\uparrow$  => Callable bond value decreases  

## Yield curve levels 
As level of the yield curve increase, the IR increases. 
An increase in IR would increase the likelihood of Put option being exercised, therefore the value of put option would increase if there is an increase in levels. 
On other hand, a decrease in IR would increase the likelihood for Call option exercise, therefore increasing the value of the call option. 

IR level $\uparrow$  => Put option value $\uparrow$
IR level $\downarrow$  => Call option value $\uparrow$

## Yield curve slope 

Using the similar argument, for levels, as the slope of the yield curve: 
- INCREASES => likelihood of put exercise increases => put option value $\uparrow$
- DECREASES => likelihood of call exercise increases => call value $\uparrow$
