#Economics 

In a competative economy, factors of production are paid their marginal product.

Profit maximization requires that the marginal product of capital equal the rental price of capital and the marginal product of labor equal the (real) wage rate.

Marginal product of Capital for [[Cobb-DouglasProductionFunction]] is: 
$$
MPK = \alpha Y / K
$$
where: 
	Y: is the output 
	alpha: is the proportion of output paid to capital
	 K: capital
  
Here MPK can also mean the rental price.
