#fixedIncome #bondsWithEmbeddedOptions 

Floating-rate bonds that pays a coupon based on an underlying reference rate. 

The rate is determined at the beginning of each period and the coupon is paid off at the end of each period. 

- Without any embedded cap or floor, the value always comes out to be 100. 
	- As it's simply returning prevailing the risk free rate, a straight floater would always be trading at par. 

Other types of floaters: 
1. [[CappedFloaters]]
2. [[FlooredFloaters]]
