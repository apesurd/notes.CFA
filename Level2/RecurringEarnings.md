- Most analysts regard Operation income as recurring. 
- Items occurring after it are considered non-recurring, e.g. other income, expenses from discontinued operations, etc. 

## Shortcoming 
However classifying items as non-recurring can be highly subjective, and hence open for manipulation. 

## Pro-forma income statements 
- Removes non-recurring items to reflect the true profitability to investors. 
- Generally not [[GAAP]] compliant 
- Analysts should pay attention to the disclosure to reconcile IS with pro-forma IS
