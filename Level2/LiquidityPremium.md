>[!Note] In the context of commercial real estate investments 

Real Estate investments have similarities with both bonds and equities as follows:
1. Bonds: 
	1. Rental income follows bond like cashflows
	2. Credit quality of the portfolio is determined by the credit quality of the tenants. 
2. Equity: 
	1. Unlike bonds, RE investors don't get a fixed value of the asset at the end of the lease. Rather the price of the property is determined by the following factors: 
		1. State of the economy. 
		2. Demand for rental property 
		3. Location 

Besides these RE also holds risks related to illiquidity, i.e. long time to exit, and high transaction fees.

 \text{Discount rate} & = \\
 & \text{Real Risk-free rate} \\
 & + \text{RP for Expected Inflation } (\theta) \\
 & + \text{RP for Inflation uncertainty } (\pi) \\
 & + \text{credit risk premium } (\gamma) \\
 & + \text{RP for uncertainty in terminal value } (\kappa) \\
 & + \text{Liquidity premium } (\phi) \\
 \end{split} 
$$

Business cycle has less effect on rental income, but is directly proportional to the property value. Thus, positively correlated with stock market.
RE has poor [[ConsumptionHedgingProperty]], like stocks.
