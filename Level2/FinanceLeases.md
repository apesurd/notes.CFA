#issCorp #CostOfCapital 

Also known as Capital-leases. 
- Can be thought as "purchase of an asset financed with debt"

- Accounting equivalent is: 
	- Lessee taking loan from lessor 
	- Purchasing asset at fair value from lessor. 

- Loan is more like a secured loan by the lessor, as the collateral can be returned if the lessee is unable to keep with the lease payment. 

> [!Definition] Rate Implicit In the Lease (RIIL)
> Interest rate implicit in this "secured loan" can be seen as the cost of secured debt for the lessor. 


Fair Value of leased Asset + Lessor's direct initial costs = 
		PV of leased asset + PV of residual value to lessor
