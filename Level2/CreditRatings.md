Applies to debt issued by corporations, quasi-government and government agencies. And also to ABS and MBS. 

Ratings issued by 3 major entities: 
1. Moody's 
2. S&P global 
3. Fitch Ratings. 
Apply similar standards across countries. 

Corporate issuer issues bonds ranked based on their credit quality: 
1. Senior Secured. 
2. Junior Secured. 
3. Senior Unsecured. 
4. Subordinated  
5. Junior Subordinated 

- Rating agencies access the quality of both the issuer and debts issued, and assigns ratings to them. 

- Bonds with rating BBB- and higher are considered investment grade, and below them are considered junk or high yield bonds. 
- Bonds in default are rated D (Moody's doesn't have D, so they use C)

- Issuers credit rating is based on it's *senior unsecured debt*.
- [[CrossDefaultProvision]] may make probability of default the same for all the tranches. 
- [[LossGivenDefault]]  can be very different though (with lowest having a higher number.)
- Based on the above factor, agencies can assign different ratings to different debts issues by the same issuer. This is known as **Notching**.

Besides the ratings, the agencies also provide rating outlook, which can be positive, negative or stable. Which suggests the near term movement of the rating.
