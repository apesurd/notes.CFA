#EquityInvestements 

Abbreviated as SGR

- retention ratio * return on equity. 
(the amount not paid in dividends would contribute to the growth of the firm by ROE)

- The above equation can be simplified as $(NI - Div) / Equity$

Rate at which the company can continue to grow indefinitely. 

- Based on [[DuPontAnalysis]], ROE can be broken down into 3 componente: 
	1. Profit margin (NI / Sales)
	2. Asset turnover (Sale / total assets)
	3. Financial leverage ( Total assets / equity)
- See [[PRATModel]]

## Assumptions:
