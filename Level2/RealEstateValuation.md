## Cost Approach 

- Calculate the cost of construction from ground up, i.e. Replacement Value 

> Replacement Cost = Land value + Rebuilding Cost^[Using current construction cost]

	- Adjustment for age 
	- Adjustment for location 
	= Property valuation 

- Since it's difficult to measure depreciation cost for older properties, the method is more appropriate to value relatively newer properties. 

## Sales Comparison Approach 
- Also known as **market approach**.
- Based on recent sales of similar properties, with most recent transactions carrying more weight. 
- Adjustment is made for: 
	- Age 
	- Location 
	- condition 
	- size 

- e.g. Avg price/rental can be used. 

## Income approach 
### Discounted cash flow approach 
Present value of expected future cash flow (Annual operating cash flow + Resale value) to the owner.

### Direct Capitalisation 

$$
\frac{\text{Net Operating Income (NOI)}}{\text{Capitalisation Rate (Cap)}}
$$
where: 
	Cap = Discount Rate - Growth rate^[Based on business condition, property quality, management effectiveness, sale of comparable properties, etc.]
	NOI is similar to EBITDA from corporate income statements.

Usually valuation is done using all the approaches and then weighted average is taken (where weights are decided on analyst's discretion) to calculate the value. 
- e.g. Low weight for cost approach, if property is pretty old. 
- High weights to sales-comparable approach when market is active with many comparable sales.

### Highest and Best Use 
- Use that would result in highest value for land. 

```
Implied land cost = 
		Estimated value of the completed real estate 
		 - All-in development costs, exit costs, developer's minimum profit requirement 
```

- May not coincide with highest value for the developed real estate property.
