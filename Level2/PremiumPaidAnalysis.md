 - Only applicable for the companies with liquid public-traded stocks. 

- Take over premium is calculated using the the Unaffected Price (UP), i.e. price before announcement, and Deal price (i.e. acquisition price). It's the %difference b/w deal and unaffected price. 
- To get a better estimate sometimes UP is taken as price one week prior to the announcement or a weeks average. 

- Takeover premium, thus calculated, is then compared against the similar transactions in the past to ascertain whether the deal is aptly priced or not.
