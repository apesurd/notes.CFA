Price of 1 unit of [[BaseCurrency]] in terms of [[PriceCurrency]]

- Base is base (i.e. denominator), price currency is the numerator.
- Sometimes it can be represented in the form of domestic vs foreign currency. where domestic would be base currency and foreign would be price currency. 

>[!Note] As per CFA, the convention is to be have [[BaseCurrency]] in denominator and [[PriceCurrency]]as numerator. 
>There are alternative conventions too.


> USD/GBP = 1.3235, implies price of 1 GBP is 1.3235 USD


From the perspective of [[Dealer]], (who wants to make a profit from spread), two rates are quoted:
1. [[BidExRate]] 
2. [[OfferExRate]]

with [[OfferExRate]] > [[BidExRate]]
> For example, given a price request from a client, a dealer might quote a two-sided price on the spot USD/EUR exchange rate of 1.1648/1.1652. This means that the dealer is willing to pay USD 1.1648 to buy one EUR and that the dealer is willing to sell one EUR for USD 1.1652.


#mnemonic 
Up-the-bid-and-multiply
Down-the-ask-and-divide

- Difference b/w [[OfferExRate]] and [[BidExRate]] is called [[SpreadExRate| Spread]]
