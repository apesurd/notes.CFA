Accounting is simple when company pays its employees in cash: 
- Assets in BS is reduced by the same amount. 
- Amount is immediately expenses in IS. 

Accounting for share based compensation is less straight forward: 
- No cash leaves the company. Hence no affect in assets. 
- But compensation is treated as an expense, and hence reduction in earnings. 

Challenges: 
1. Fair value of stocks/options may be hard to estimate as the shares may not be publicly traded. 
2. Maybe granted with contingencies (e.g. minimum holding period)

>[!Note] 
>Both [[IFRS]] and [[GAAP]] have similar standards for accounting for share-based compensation 


Types of share based compensations: 
1. [[StockGrants]]
2. [[StockOptions]]
3. [[PhantomStocks]]
4. [[StockAppreciationRights]]

 - Employees bear the risk of stocks in case of [[StockGrants]] and [[StockOptions]]
