Probability of Earnings manipulation. 
Involves calculation of M-Score. 
- Value greater than -1.78 implies higher probability of earnings manipulation. 

M-Score = 
	- 4.84
	+ 0.920 [[BeneishModel#DSRI|DSRI]]
	+ 0.528 [[BeneishModel#GMI|GMI]]
	+ 0.404 [[BeneishModel#AQI |AQI ]]
	+ 0.892 [[BeneishModel#SGI |SGI ]]
	+ 0.115 [[BeneishModel#DEPI |DEPI ]]
	- 0.172 [[BeneishModel#SGAI |SGAI ]]
    + 4.679 [[BeneishModel#Accruals |Accruals ]]
	- 0.327 [[BeneishModel#LEVI |LEVI ]]

# 8 variables

## DSRI 
Days Sales Receivable Index = $DSR_t / DSR_{t-1}$

$\uparrow$ DSRI (inappropriate revenue recognition)
## GMI 
Gross Margin Index = $GM_{t-1} / GM_t$
GMI > 1 -> gross margin deteriorated 
- Firm with declining GM more likely to manipulate earnings 
## AQI 
Asset Quality Index = $AQ_t / AQ_{t-1}$
Asset Quality = (NCA - PPE) / Total Assets

- AQI > 1 -> proportion of non-current assets (less PPnE) have increased. 
- May indicate excess expenditure capitalisation 
## SGI 
Sales Growth index = $Sales_t$ / $Sales_{t-1}$

- Not a measure of manipulation itself, but growth companies tend to be under pressure to manipulate to meet growth expectations. 
## DEPI 
Depreciation Index = $DR_{t-1}$ / $DR_t$
	where DR = Depreciation / (Depreciation + PPnnE)

- DEPI > 1 -> assets depreciated at slower rate. 
## SGAI 
SGnA Index = ($SGnA_t$ / $Sales_t$) / ($SGnA_{t-1} / Sales_{t-1}$)

SGAI > 1 -> increase in SGnA expense 
- indicate decrease in admin efficiency -> predispose companies to manipulate. 
## Accruals 
Accruals = (Income before extraordinary items - cash flow from operations) / total assets 

- Higher accruals can indicate earnings manipulation
## LEVI 
Leverage Index = $Lev_t / Lev_{t-1}$
Increase in leverage -> predispose companies to manipulate. 

# Drawbacks 
1. Based on fin. stmts.; Accounting data may not accurately reflect economic reality of the company. (e.g. Off balance sheet items ) 
2. Manipulators might take into account the number reported by the test and further refine the manipulation.
