#Economics 

Explains TFP within the model, rather than treating it as exogenous.

Investment in capital can permanently affect the growth in tech. 
	This is because the definition of capital is broadened to include human capital and RnD.
	Due to *Societal effect*, TFP can increase, which in turn increase Growth rate. 

May not reach a steady state growth, but may permanently increase growth rate by investments in human capital and RnD.

Population growth is independent of GDP. 

Savings/Investments permanently increases rate of economic growth

NO diminishing marginal effects.
