#multiFactorModels #portfolioManagement 

 [[CAPM]] is an example of a single factor model, where only one systematic risk factor determines the return of the portfolio.

In constrast, a multifactor model assumes more than one systematic risk factors determines return of the portfolio. 

$$
E(R_P) = R_f + \beta_{p1}\lambda_1 + \beta_{p2}\lambda_2 + ... + \beta_{pk}\lambda_k
$$
	where $\beta_p$: factor sensitivity of portfolio 
				$\lambda$: factor risk premium 

- It is a construct of [[ArbitragePricingTheory]]
- If the assumptions of [[ArbitragePricingTheory]] holds then multifactor model holds. 

## Types of multi factor model 
1. [[MacroEconomicModel]]
2. [[FundamentalModel]]
3. [[StatisticalModel]]
