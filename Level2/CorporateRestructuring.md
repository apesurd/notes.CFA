# Macro Drivers
## High security prices 
- Increase in all corporate actions. Due to: 
	- Higher CEO confidence 
	- Lower financing costs: both debt and equity financed acquisitions will be made at lower cost. 
	- Management knows that their stock is overvalued; Opportunity to make equity-financed acquisitions 
- Empirical evidences suggest that corporate actions done during weaker times create more value. 

## Industry shock 
- Managers follow what others in the industry are doing. FOMO.
