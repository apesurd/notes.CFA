Changes of significant magnitude in multiple risk factors. 

Set of risk factor changes used in scenarios analysis are often the ones which are expected to result in significant decline in portfolio value. 

Can also be used to positive scenarios. 

Two approaches: 
1. **Historical approach**
		Use actual set of scenarios from the past can be used for equities
		For bonds and options, Valuation models can be used since price history may not exist. 
		Two types: 
		1. Instantaneous : More conservative. More realistic if scenario unfolds very quickly
		2. Incremental : Less conservative as it allows the manager to reduce/close some positions and/or adjust hedges. More realistic if scenario unfolds slowly.
		Improbable that the exact same scenario will play out in the future. 
		
2. **Hypothetical approach**
	   Do not rely on history 
	   not limited to any assumption of distribution
	   Stress test is a form of scenario analysis. 
	   Reverse stress testing. Go from unacceptable scenario
		Hypothetical scenarios may incorrectly specify how risk factors will co-move.
		Difficult to establish the appropriate limits for a test.
