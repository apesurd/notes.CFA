#EquityInvestements 

## Advantages 
1. Terminal value does not dominate intrinsic value. 
2. Applicable when RI is negative and volatile. 
3. Uses readily available accounting data, so easier to compute) 

Model is appropriate to use when: 
- Terminal value is highly uncertain. 
- Firm does not pay dividends, or when expected free cash flow is negative or volatile. 

## Weakness 
1. Accounting data may be manipulated by management 
2. Accounting data may require significant adjustments. 

There is uncertainty or lock of confidence in the estimates of book value or ROE. 


## Accounting considerations 
### Violations of clean surplus relationship 
i.e. Ending BVPS is not equal to (Begin BVPS + NI - Div. )

Reasons: 
1. Foreign currency translation gains and losses using [[CurrentRateMethod]] . 
2. Certain pension adjustments. 
3. Gains/losses on hedging instruments . 
4. Changes in revaluation surplus for long-lived assets. (IFRS only)
5. Changes in the value of certain liabilities due to changes in the liability's credit risk. (IFRS only)
6. Changes in the market value of debt and equity instruments classified as available-for-sale 

### Adjustment for fair value 
Common adjustments to reflect fair value: 
1. SPEs whose assets and liabilities are not reflected in the financial statements of the parent company should be consolidated. 
2. Reserves and allowances should be adjusted. 
3. Inventory for companies that use LIFO should be adjusted to FIFO. 
4. The pension asset or liability should be adjusted to reflect the funded status of the plan. 

### Intangible assets 
After merger, some intangible assets would increase the book value of the equity, which would reduce the combined ROE (in comparison to the combined ROE of pre-merger entities)
- To mitigate this, the analyst should remove Intangible assets prior to computing the ROE used in RO models. 

ROE estimate for a mature company should reflect the long-term productivity of the company's RnD expenditure. If RnD expenditure is expected to improve long-term growth, then it should be capitalised. And Vice-versa. 

### Non-recurring items 
- Remove items that are not expected to continue in the future. 
	- Extraordinary items 
	- gains and losses from asset sales. 
	- asset write-downs 
	- provisions for future losses. 
	- Changes in accounting estimates. 

### Aggressive accounting practices. 
- Keep an eye for 
	- Accelerating revenues 
	- Deferring expenses. 

### International accounting differences. 
As RI models are heavily reliant on accounting data, it can be difficult to compare two companies using different accounting standards. 
- Check if
	- earnings forecasts are reliable 
	- Are there systematic violations of the clean surplus relation? 
	- Are the financial results consistent with the economic reality of the business.
