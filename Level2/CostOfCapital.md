#issCorp #CostOfCapital

Capital components of a firm contains debt, equity and [[PreferredStocks]]. 

## Factors affecting [[WeightedAverageCostOfCapital]]
### Top down approach 
External / macro factors affect credit spread (for bond market) and equity risk premium (for equity market) which will trickle down to cost of capital of individual companies. 

#### Availability of Capital 
- Higher the availability, lower would be the risk premium / credit spread. 
- Developed economies have higher liquidity, stable currencies and better investor protection. 
- whereas in developing economies availability of capital is tight. 

#### Expected inflation 
- Decrease would lower the sovereign bond yield and thus reducing the risk free rate. 
#### Interest rates 
- Central bank lowering benchmark interest rates decreases risk free rate. 
#### Macro economic environment 
- In strong economies investors are more willing to take risk 
	- which reduces both credit spread and ERP 

#### Legal and regulatory 
- Countries with [[CommonLaw]] provide protection to investors, which might not be as efficient for countries with [[CivilLaw]]
- Industries which are highly regulated, like finance and utilities, would have higher cost of raising capital due to constraints imposed on them (wrt. capital structure, payout policy, pricing)

#### Tax Jurisdiction 
If the tax is higher, the company would prefer higher proportion of debt (to get tax benefits on interest payments to bond holders)

### Bottom up approach 
Company specific factors. 

#### Volatility in earnings, revenues and cash-flow 
- Lower the volatility, lower the perceived risk of the company hence lower the cost of capital. 
- Characteristics of low volatility 
	- Non-cyclical business 
	- Large pool of customers, hence lower concentration risk 
	- Low leverage 
- Some investors also consider Corporate governance and ESG considerations 

#### Asset Nature and Liquidity 
- Debt investors would demand less risk premium if [[Collaterals]] have high recovery values. i.e. tangible and fungible (non-specialised)
- Though this reduces the risk-premium for secured debt, it increase the premium for Unsecured debt (inferior claim)

#### Financial Strength, Profitability and Leverage 
- With high profitability the ease of generating cash is higher. 
- Low leverage measures: 
	- debt-to-equity 
	- debt-to-EBITDA 
	- Interest-coverage

#### Security features 
- CallableBond saves issuers in times of low interest rates, so they can refinance at lower cost. Premium is higher. 
- PutableBond allows investor to put back the bond in times of higher interest rates, thus requires low premium. 
- [[ConvertibleBonds]] also require low premium. 

- Value of [[PreferredStocks]] and shares with high voting power (Class A) would require lower cost of equity.
