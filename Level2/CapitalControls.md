- One way is to hold sufficient foreign exchange reserves. 
- Country buys it's own currency in foreign exchange market and thus stabilises the currency to a stable rate. 
- This lead to reduction of speculative capital flow into the country.

For developed market, foreign exchange reserve is very less in comparison to the trading volume. In this case, free market trading has much more influence than the central bank interventions, rendering the central banks efforts ineffective. 

Effectiveness in the case of emerging market is less clear. But an emerging markets foreign reserve might be influential in stabilising the exchange rates.
