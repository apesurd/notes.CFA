- Issuer of the risky bond is called the reference entity. 
- **Reference Obligation** is the debt issued by the reference entity, usually senior unsecured ones. 

Credit default occurs only if reference (or other equal or higher seniority) bond defaults. 

[[RecoveryRate]] is determined based on the market value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond that has the same seniority as the reference obligation.
