#portfolioManagement #multiFactorModels 

Made up primarily of two components (similar to [[AttributionOfActiveReturn]])

1. Active Factor risk: Deviation from benchmark's factor sensitivities
2. Active specific risk: Due to security selection. 
	   $$
	   Active_specific_risk = \sum (W_p - W_b)^2\sigma^2_{\epsilon}
	 $$

> [!Note] Both components mentioned above are expressed as variances , not std. 

`Active specific risk + Active factor risk = Active Risk Squared`
