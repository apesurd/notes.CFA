## Contingent assets and liabilities 
Potential gains and losses that may occur in the future depending on the outcome of a specific event. 
e.g. ASSET: Lawsuit against another company for copyright infringement. 
LIABILITY: Under investigation for a significant regulatory infringement. 

### [[IFRS]] 
- Contingent assets are never recognised. 
- Liabilities are handled differently: 
	- AT ACQUISITION: only those whose fair value can be measured reliably are recognised. 
	- SUBSEQUENT PERIOD: Higher of initial recognised value vs best estimate of amt needed to settle. 

### US [[GAAP]]
Divided into contractual vs non contractual assets and liabilities. 
- AT ACQUISITION: 
	- CONTRACTUAL: recorded at fair value 
	- NON CONTRACTUAL:  recorded only if it "more likely than not" meet the definition of an asset or liability. 
- SUBSEQUENT 
	- ASSETS: lower of initial recognised value vs best settlement of settlement amt
	- LIABILITY: higher of initial recognised value vs best settlement of settlement amt

## In-process RnD 
- AT ACQUISITION 
	- As intangible asset at fair value 
- SUBSEQUENT 
	- if successful, then amortised. 
	- If unsuccessful, then impaired. 
	
## Contingent considerations 
Negotiated as part of the acquisition price. 
e.g. Acquirer will pay more if the firm hits the profit target in 2 years. This will be a liability to the acquirer as it is a possible future cash expense. 
- AT ACQUISITION: 
	- Asset, liability or equity are accounted at fair value in BS. 
- SUBSEQUENT 
	- changes in assets and liabilities are recognised in consolidated income statement. 
	- changes in equity is not remeasured. i.e. changes are settled within equity and not via the income statement. 

## Restructuring costs.
Restructuring costs associated with business combination are expensed as incurred. 
Capitalisation on balance sheet is not allowed.
