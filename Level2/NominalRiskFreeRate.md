In reality the assumption of zero inflation hardly holds. 
Therefore we take into account two more factors to estimate nominal risk free rate. 
1. Risk Premium for inflation expectation ($\theta$) 
	3m US T-bills is a good proxy for nominal risk free rate. Only takes $\theta$ into account.
1. Risk Premium for uncertainty in inflation ($\pi$)
	   Only holds for long time horizons
