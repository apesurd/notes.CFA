#portfolioManagement 

Active risk corresponding  to the highest sharpe ratio. 
TC for [[UnconstrainedPortfolio]]  is 1. 

$$
\sigma_A^* = (IR^* * TC)/SR_B * \sigma_B
$$
	where $IR^*$ is the information ratio 
			$SR_B$ is the sharpe ratio of the benchmark 
			$\sigma_B$ is the risk associated with the benchmark 


## SR of optimal portfolio 
$$
SR_P^* = \sqrt{(SR_B^2 + IR^{*2}*TC^2)}
$$

## Expected active return of optimal portfolio 
$$
E(R_A^*) = \sigma_A^* * IR^*
$$
