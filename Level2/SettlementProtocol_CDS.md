CDS can be settled by physical or cash settlement. 

## Physical settlement 
Risky bond is delivered to the CDS seller at notional price. 
- Less common 

## Cash settlement 
- CDS buyer holds on to the risky bond 
- CDS seller pays Notional * (1 - Recovery rate)
- Recovery rate is determined by the market value of the cheapest-to-deliver bond that has the same seniority as the reference obligation.
	- Maturity of the bond does not matter.
