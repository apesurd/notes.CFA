Exchange Traded Notes are a class of ETFs where the issuer (typically a Bank) does not hold the underlying securities, where the issues issues unsecured debt obligations that promises to pay the return on an index less the management fees. 

Banks enters into an Equity Swap as the fixed rate payer and equity return receiver, such that the equity return can be passed on the ETF investors. 

The amount the bank gets from the investors can be lend out to borrowers at higher interest rates.
