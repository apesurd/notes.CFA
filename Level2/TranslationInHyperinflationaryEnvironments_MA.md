- Hyperinflation significantly underreport in case of [[CurrentRate_MA]]  for [[Translation_MA]] 
- This might not reflect the economic reality of the situation, as the value of the non-monetary assets and liabilities can go up during hyperinflation. 

To better reflect the reality of the situation both [[GAAP]] and [[IFRS]] provide alternative way of accounting. (Reporting standards are considered for the parent firm.)
> [!Tip] IFRS way of accounting is more complicated here, unlike GAAP way for recognising PBO related accounting in [[EmployeeCompensation]] section. 


## GAAP (simple)
- Hyperinflation: When the appreciation in currency is over 100% during last three years. 
- In case of hyperinflation, [[PresentationCurrency]] can be considered as [[FunctionalCurrency]] and therefore [[TemporalMethod]] can be used instead of [[CurrentRateMethod]] of accounting. 

## IFRS 
- No formal definition of hyperinflation, but criteria used for [[GAAP]] can suggest that hyperinflation exists. 
- IFRS requires that financial statements be reinstated for inflation, before converted to [[FunctionalCurrency]] using [[CurrentRateMethod]]. ([[TemporalMethod]] is not used)

### Summary of the method: 
1. Balance sheet 
	1. Divide assets and liabilities into monetary and non-monetary sections. 
	2. Monetary assets and liabilities remain unaffected, but non-monetary ones need to be adjusted based on the change in the underlying currency's price index since acquisition date. 
	   i.e. $value * \frac{P_{final}}{P_{init}}$
	3. Common equity receives the same treatment as mentioned in #2 based on the reporting date or date of contribution (if later). 
	4. Retained earnings are calculated by balancing the BS. 
2. Income statement
	1. Both revenue and expenses are reinstated using fractional changes in the price index of the underlying currency from the date when the transaction occurred. 
	2. Net income is calculated using
			$RE_{final} = RE_{init} + NI - Div$
			where $RE_{init}$ is the retained earnings for the previous reporting period. 
	3. To balance the income statement, a plug figure of "Net Purchasing Power gain/loss" is reported in the income statement.
