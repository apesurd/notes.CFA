- Company is exposed to foreign currency transactions, when it engages is foreign currency denominated transactions. 

- When a transaction is made, actual payment may not be received sometime later. 
- That's why transaction date and payment date would differ. Company bears the risk of interest rate fluctuations between these two dates. 

- Foreign currency transactions are typically measured on transaction dates. 

>[!Note] If reporting date lies in the middle of t.date and p.date then: 
>- B/S amt. adjusted based on exchange rate on reporting date. 
>- Unrealised gains/losses are recorded in the IS. 

- US [[GAAP]] and [[IFRS]] don't have specifications on if the FX gains/losses should be reported as operating or non-operating section. 
	- So analyst should make adjustments to improve comparability between the firms.
