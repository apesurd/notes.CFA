For Non exchange markets, i.e. markets not managed by a clearing house, a trade may reach out to a dealer who might not be providing the best price but is able to complete the entire trade.
This might be done based on the reputation or less counter party risk of the dealer, or due to the fear of adverse price movements in the dealer quotes from other traders.
