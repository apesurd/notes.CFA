Coveres multiple issuers 
- Pricing depends on the correlation of default. 
- Analogous to ETF/Index funds for CDS. 
- All are equally weighted and notional amount is attributed equally to all the issuers. 

- CDS spread depends on the correlation of default among the entities in the index. 
- Higher the correlation, the higher would be the spread. 

In case of credit event, only the proportion corresponding to the affected CDS is settled. 
After the settlement, Notional amount is reduced by the notional amount originally attributed to the now-settled CDS.
