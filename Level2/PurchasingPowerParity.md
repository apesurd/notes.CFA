Ex-Ante form of PPP suggests relationship between Expected Inflation Rate Differentials and Expected change in Exchange Rate.

Based on law of 1 Price.

## Absolute PPP 
applied law of one price on the basket of goods, i.e. on CPI.
$s_{A/B}$ = $CPI_A / CPI_B$

>[!Note] The above relationship only holds true if there are no trade restrictions and costs involved.

## Relative PPP
Assuming there are no trade restrictions and cost:
$$
\%\Delta(s_{A/B}) = Inflation_A - Inflation_B
$$
Changes in exchange rate wrt the relative change in price levels.

## Ex-Ante Relative PPP
Forward looking measure of relative PPP. 
Violation of relative PPP in short-term is common as there is no true arbitrage to hold the relationship. 
But in the long run, the relationship is approximately equal.
