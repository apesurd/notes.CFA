#Economics 

In order to compare the GDPs of different countries, use PPP instead of FX-rates because FX-rates are volatile and would not take into the account the non-tradable goods. 

eg. since labour is in short supply in London then in Mexico, the price for haircut would be higher in London than in Mexico. FX-rates wouldn't take that into account.
