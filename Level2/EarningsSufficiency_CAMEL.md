Earnings are of high quality if they are sustainable and adequate^[rate of return > cost of capital].
- Ideally growth trend should be positive
- underlying accounting estimates should be unbiased 
- Should be derived from recurring sources. 

## Sources of earning: 
1. Net interest income 
2. Service income 
3. Trading income 

- Since trading income is more volatile, and hence banks with higher proportion of net interest income and service income would have more sustainable earnings. 

- Another source of earning comes from unrealised gains from fair value securities that the bank holds.   
- Since there is a potential to manipulate the fair values of the securities, US [[GAAP]] and [[IFRS]] have categorised securities into 3 levels, based on inputs for determining fair value.  
	- **Level1**: Quoted market prices of identical assets. 
	- **Level2**: Observable but NOT quoted market prices of identical assets. 
		  - Quoted price of similar asset  
		  - Quoted price of IDENTICAL asset (non-active)
		  - Observable IR, spreads, implied volatility. 
	- **Level3**: Non-observable, hence subjective. 
		  - based on models 
		  - estimate of Future cash flow 
		  - estimate of discount rate. 

- Banks usually use fair value hierarchy to label the assets.
- Some banks also breakdown the fair value of their assets, so if the proportion of level3 assets are relatively higher that may indicate higher subjectivity in the accounting and hence lower confidence in the reported earnings.
