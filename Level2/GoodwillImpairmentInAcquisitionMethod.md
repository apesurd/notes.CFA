Goodwill is an intangible asset, which is not amortised but tested regularly for impairment (at least once a year)

If acquirer's unit is unable to realise the potential of the business combination, then goodwill is partially or fully written off using an impairment process. 
Once written down, the goodwill can't be later reversed. 

## Under [[IFRS]] 
Cash-generating Unit: Acquirer's unit that is expected to reap benefits from combination with the acquiree

If the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount^[Greater of fair value less selling cost or it's value in use] then the difference is written down, first absorbed by goodwill. 

## Under US [[GAAP]] 
Reporting Unit : Acquirer's unit that is expected to reap benefits from combination with the acquiree  

If carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then impairment is deemed to exist. 
If impairment exists, we shift our focus from examining the value of the goodwill from the unit. Loss is calculated as the carrying value of GW less the implied fair value^[Fair value of reporting unit - fair value of identifiable net assets] of GW.
This amount is then written down from GW.
