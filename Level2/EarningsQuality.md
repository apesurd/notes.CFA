#FSA #financialReportsQuality 

Assuming the reporting is [[GAAP]] compliant and contains [[DecisionUsefulInformation]], one should review earnings from the lens of: 
- Adequacy  (cover cost of capital)
- Sustainable (expected to recur in the future)
  Can be assessed by: 
  1. [[RecurringEarnings]]
  2. [[PersistentEarnings]]

## Other indicators of low-quality earnings 
- Look for companies which repeatedly meet or exceed consensus earnings estimates. 
- Look for external indicators, such as enforcement/warnings from regulators. 
	  - Since it's public information, stock prices take this into account. 

## Earnings manipulation examples 
### Revenue recognition 
- Can be subjective as practices are determined by the management. 
- Analyst should pay attention to how the revenues are generated. 
	- [[ChannelStuffing]]
	- [[BillAndHold]]
	- HeavyDiscount

- Compare companies revenue trends wrt the industry. 

- High receivables growth in comparison to revenue growth is a red flag. 
	- Can be calculated using [[DaysSalesOutstanding]]
	- Increasing trend in DSO is an indication of poor revenue quality. 

- Proportion of accruals vs cash flow. 
	- Higher accruals make earnings easier to manipulate. 

- Data inconsistencies 

- Related-party transactions 
	- Say large sale to subsidiary to boost earnings. 
### Capitalisation of expenses 
- Certain expenses are capitalised and depreciated/amortised in future.
	- This results in shifting current expenses in future, thus leading to higher income.

- Unsupported increase in non-current assets is one of the signs to look out for. 
- Another sign is decrease in [[AssetTurnoverRatio]] but revenue is constant. 

- Compare (Depreciation / Total Assets) wrt the peers. 
	- If much lower -> sign of delaying depreciation

- Check for problematic related party transactions 
	- Shifting resources to a privately held company that is owned by senior managers. 
	- Propping practices (profits from related entities temporarily prop up an ailing public company)
