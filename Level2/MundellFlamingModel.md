#Economics 

- For SHORT-TERM
- considers both MONETARY and FISCAL policies
- effect on exchange rates
## Assumptions
1. Inflation is not a factor
2. Flexible (floating) exchange rate #Q 

Model distinguishes b/w high-capital mobility (developed economies) and low-capital mobility (developing economies) => determined by access to capital flow

Effect of monetary policy remains the same in both distinctions:
1. Expansionary -> IR $\downarrow$  -> outflow $\downarrow$ -> currency $\downarrow$
2. i.e. expansionary monetary policy lead to depreciation of the domestic currency.
3. The opposite holds true for restrictive monetary policy

### High Capital mobility
FISCAL DEFICIT -> Currency appreciation.
When there is fiscal deficit, i.e. more spending then tax collections, then the government would need to borrow and thus need to provide a better IR to the investors, this increases IR would lead to increase in inflow and thus the currency would appreciate. 

>[!Tip] 2nd and 4th quadrant would have decreased and increased currency strength respectively, under High mobility

### Low Capital mobility
FISCAL DEFICIT -> Currency depreciation.
When there is fiscal deficit, i..e more spending then tax collection, then the value of imports would exceed the value of exports, thus in order to compensate for it domestic currency needs to be sold more and hence would lose its value.

>[!Tip] 1st and 3rd quadrant would have decreased and increased currency strength respectively, under low mobility


# Comparison with Uncovered Interest Rate Parity
[[UncoveredInterestRateParity]] suggests that currency $\downarrow$ when IR $\uparrow$  , which is opposite to what's suggested by Mundell-Fleming model.

- In short term uncovered Interest rate parity does not hold. and Mundell-Fleming model is only applicable for short-term.
- "Inflation is not a factor " is an assumption for Mundell-Fleming model
