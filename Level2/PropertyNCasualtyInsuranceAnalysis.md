	- Covers specific assets against loss due to covered events. 
- Casualty (Liability) Insurance 
	- Protects against a legal liability to a third party due to the occurrence of a covered event. 

- Multiple Peril Insurance: Covers both property and casualty losses. 

## Revenues 
- Premium Income is the major income.
- For each period, the following figures for premium are reported: 
	 - Net Premiums Written: Amounts paid by policyholders.  
	- Net Premiums Earned : Premiums are considered earned only when full obligation is fulfilled. 

- Fee income and investment income are other sources of income.

- Loss reserve: Account kept aside to cater for future claims.
	- is subject to management discretion. 
	- During each period it can be increased or decreased which is expensed as "Loss Adjustment expense"
	- Downward revision suggests that company was conservative in the estimation in the past, whereas upward revisions aggressive accounting in the past (warning sign for the analyst)

- For new contracts
	- Underwriting expense 
	- Commissions 

- Dividends: to the policy holders 

## Profitability Ratios 
1. Loss and loss adjustment ratio: success in estimation of risks insured. 
   - denominator is premiums EARNED  
   - Lower the better
2. Underwriting expense ratio: efficiency of obtaining new premiums 
   - Denominator is premiums WRITTEN 
   - Lower the better. 
3. Combined ratio: Aggregation of both the above ratios. 
   - Should be less than 100 for the firm to be deemed profitable. 
4. Dividends to policyholders ratio: 
   - Denominator is premium EARNED 
   - Lower the better. 
5. Combined ratio after dividends (CRAD):
   - Sum of above two. 
   - More comprehensive measure of the overall efficiency as in factors in the dividend paid as well. 
6. Total Investment return ratio: 
	   - Total Investment income / Invested Assets 
7. Total Investment return ratio (less unrealized g/l)

## Industry wide analysis 
Combined ratio can be aggregated for the entire industry as a whole. 
- A low ratio suggests that overall the industry is efficient and profitable. 

Industry combined ratio drives the pricing model in cycles of:   
- HIGH PRICING MARKET: When the ratio is low, 
	  - healthy margins 
	  - Growth
	  - Invite more competition 
-  SOFT PRICING MARKET: ratio is high 
	- Price cutting 
	- Lower margins 
	- Weed out the inefficient competitors. 

## Investment income Analysis
- FLOAT PERIOD: Period between the receipt of premiums and payments of claims. 
- Insurer can invest the premiums collected during this period, the income received is often known as FLOAT.
- Insurers tend to invest conservatively, thus diversifying it across: 
	- Geography
	- Sectors 
	- Maturity 
	- Assets 

### Liquidity 
- Use fair value hierarchy (similar to banks)
- Assets labelled as level 1 are more liquid, as hierarchy also reflects the liquidity status. 

## Capital requirement 
- No global risk-based capital requirement standards for insurers. 
- Regionally EU has adopted [[SOLVENCY2]] regime. 
- In US, [[NationalAssociationofInsuranceCommisioners]] have specified minimum capital requirement based on the size and risk of the insurer, which is a function of:
  - Asset risk 
  - Credit risk 
  - Underwriting risk 
  - Other relevant risks.
