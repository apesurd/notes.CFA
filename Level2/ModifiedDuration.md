Approximate % change in a bond's price for a 1% change in the bond's yield to maturity. 

slope of line (on bond price vs YTM) = - ModDur

$$
ApproxModDur = \frac{V_- - V_+}{2 V_0 \; \Delta YTM}
$$
- Approximate modified duration would be very close to modified duration, if: 
	- YTM change is very low. 
	- Precision in the calculation is high. 

- Not meaningful for bonds with embedded options, as cash flow is uncertain.
