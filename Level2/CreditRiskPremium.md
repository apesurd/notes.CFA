Bonds issued by corporates and developing countries often has a default risk associated with them. This premium for accommodating this risk is called credit risk premium ($\gamma$)

Business Cycles are directly proportional  to the real risk free rate (reference [[RealRiskFreeRate]] )

During the downturn defaults increase and recovery decrease. 
Credit spread tend to widen during economic downturns and narrowed during upturn. 

> Inverse relationship b/w business cycle and credit risk premium. 

Credit risk bonds outperforms risk free bonds, during upturn in business cycle. 
Opposite is true during the downturn in business cycle. 

Lower rated risky bonds would be even more sensitive to business cycles, would *outperform/underperform* higher rated risky bonds during business *upturn/downturn*. 

## Effect of sectors

[[CyclicalIndustries]] would be more sensitive to business cycles then [[DefensiveIndustries]]. 
The same above relationship would be applicable for credit spread as well.
