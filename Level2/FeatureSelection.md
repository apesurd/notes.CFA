#BigData 

Process whereby only pertinent features from the dataset are selected for ML model training.
Selecting fewer features, reduces model complexity and reduces training time.

Different from data preprocessing steps, as it requires good understanding of the data, statistical significance and an assistance of [[ExploratoryDataAnalysis]]

It's also different from [[DimensionalityReduction]] as it doesn't create any new features.
