Visual representation of [[Clustering]] algorithm's output.
- x-axis shows the clusters
- y-axis represent the distance b/w the clusters.
- Clusters are represented by horizontal line which connect two vertical lines. This line is called **dendrites**
- The height of dendrite represents the distance b/w the two clusters being considered.

- The horizontal dashed line cutting across the dendrites show the number of clusters into which the data are split at each stage.
