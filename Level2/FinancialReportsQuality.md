#FSA #financialReportsQuality 

# Framework 

Two basic questions: 
1. Are underlying fin. reports GAAP compliant and has [[DecisionUsefulInformation]]?
2. Are the earnings of high quality? 

Viewed along two highly related dimensions:
## Earnings Quality
- High: 
	- Sufficient to meet ROI 
	- Sustainable 

- Low 
	- Bad performance 
	- Misrepresentation of economic performance 
## Reporting Quality 
Assessment of the information disclosed in the financial reports. 
 
- High quantify reporting is GAAP compliant. 
- It's best if GAAP compliant reporting has [[DecisionUsefulInformation]].
- In general high quality reporting enables assessment, whereas low quality reporting impedes assessment. 
- When quality is low, it's not meaningful to assess the reports. 


# Potential problems affecting quality 
## Measurement and timing 
Concerned with reported amount on fin. stmts. and timing of recognition. 
1. Revenue recognition 
   - Neither conservative or aggressive accounting leads to [[DecisionUsefulInformation]] in fin. stmts. 
2. Expense Recognition 
   - Omitting or postponement of expense would increase NI, total assets and equity. 
3. Overstatement of fair value of assets and/or understating fair value of liabilities 
   - Can lead to overstated equity. 
## Misclassification 
1. Operating expense as non-operating expense in IS. 
	   Misguides by treating a recurring expense as one time cost. 
2. ST asset as LT asset in BS. 
	   Increases inventory turnover ratio. 
	   Decreases current ratio. 
3. CFI as CFO in cashflow statement. 
	   Inflates cashflow from operations. 
## Business Combinations 
1. Masking decline of CFO for acquirer 
2. Incentive for aggressive accounting/misreporting 
	   - Acquirer, if purchasing using stocks, have incentive to get his share prices higher. 
	   - Acquiree, similarly, would want to have higher valuation prior to acquisition 
3. Can be impetus for acquisitions 
	   - Acquire a company with dissimilar operations / less publicly available information to hide past accounting irregularities. 
4. Overestimating goodwill 
	   - Since excess allocated to tangibles is deprecated, the acquirer has an incentive to overestimating good will to reduce amortisation expenses and hence increasing profit. 
## Divergence from economic reality 
1. Usage of [[SpecialPurposeEntity]] to hide off-balance sheet items. E.g. Enron 
2. Impairment/Restructuring losses: 
	   - Can be an indication of overstatement of income in prior periods. 
3. Impairment/Restructuring provisions: 
	   - Shift future expenses into current period.
