Based on [[GordonGrowthModel]], value of the company can be calculated using:  $V_0 = D_1 / (r_e - g)$, where 
	- $D_1$ : Next period dividend 
	- $r_e$ : Return on equity 
	- g : earnings growth rate 


## ERP calculation
- After rearrangement 
$$

$$

$$ 
 \begin{split} 
r_e &= D_1 / V_0 + g \\\\

\text{Mkt expected return} &= \text{Mkt. Div yield} + \text{Earnings growth rate} \\\\

\text{ERP} &= \text{Mkt. Div yield} + \text{Earnings growth rate} - \text{Risk-Free rate}\\\\
 \end{split} 
$$
 
> [!Formula]
> GGM ERP = 1-yr forecasted mkt. div yield + Long-term earnings growth rate - long-term govt. bond yield
- Reliable method to estimate for developed market. 

WEAKNESS: 
- Forecasts can change over time 
	- hence, need to be updated. 
- Assumption of stable growth rate is not appropriate for rapidly growing economies. 
- To counter this another approach for calculating return on equity: 
	1. Forecast future cash flows for the stages, (i.e. rapid growth, transition and mature growth) 
	2. Discount all the stages cash-flow with $r_e$ and equate it to equity index price. 
	3. ERP would be $r_e$ less govt. bond yield. 

## Required return calculation 
- ASSUMPTION: Stocks are fairly valued, therefore $V_0==P_0$
$$
r_e = D_1 / P_0 + g
$$
- Should only be used for the stocks of public company which are publicly traded, 
	- Can't be used for the valuation of private companies.
