- Private firms are not publicly listed. 
- Can be sole proprietorships, privately-held corporations or previously public companies taken private. 

## Differences from public companies 

- Both company and stock specific factors are used in the valuation models. 
- Private companies have a wide range of variations and therefore a wide range of discount rates and methods are used for valuation. 

### Company specific factors 
Can have negative or positive effects on valuation. 

#### 1. Stage of lifecycle 
Private companies are generally less mature, or highly mature (i..e on the verge of bankruptcy)


####  2. Firm size 
- Private companies are usually smaller in size, with less capital, fewer assets and fewer employees. 
- Hence more risky, therefore required return and risk premium is usually higher in comparison to a public firm. 
- Since they are not publicly listed, they have less options to get capital, on the bright side they don't have to face[[RegulatoryBurden]]. 

####  3. Quality of financial reporting 
- Quality of financial reporting is non-standard, less transparent, hence more risky. 
	- This can lead to lower valuation of the firm. 
- In case of fairness options, analyst has access to the firm's financial statements and business records. 

#### 4. Quality of depth of management. 
- lack of capital ->  less qualified employees -> Lower growth and higher risk 


####  5. Management - shareholder overlap 
- Substantial ownership by management -> Can have long-term perspective 
- Minority shareholders have less influence. 


#### 6. Tax concerns 
Management can report less income to pay less tax. 

### Stock specific factors. 
Generally have negative effect on the valuation. 
#### 1. Stock liquidity 
- Less liquid stocks 
- Fewer potential owners 
- Require liquidity discounts. 

#### 2. Restrictions on marketability 
- Sometimes restrictions about the selling of shares. 
#### 3. Concentration on control
- Actions benefits the controlling owners 
	- Can be at the expense of minority shareholders.
