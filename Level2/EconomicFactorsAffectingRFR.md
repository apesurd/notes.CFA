## $\uparrow$ GDP Growth expectation 
When people expect better economic expectations, the marginal utility of the future consumption would decrease. i.e. the amount of utility for the same spend would be lower, therefore they would expect higher risk free rate to forgo current consumption. 

AS A RESULT REAL RISK FREE RATE WOULD INCREASE. 


## $\downarrow$ GDP Growth expectation 
Otherwise if there are expectations of slow growth, people would tend to save for future consumption, which would lead to REDUCED RISK FREE RATE.

## Effects of Risk aversion
If we take risk aversion into account, even risk premium for uncertainty will be positively related to the expected volatility of the GDP growth.
