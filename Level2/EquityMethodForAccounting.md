General premise is that investee's profits and losses are reflected in the investor's balance sheet. 
Also refer's to as one-line consolidation

At initiation, the investment is recorded in investor's BS as a non-current asset, we call this an investment account. 
In subsequent periods, when associate makes profit and losses, the proportional value is added or subtracted from the investment account. 
- Dividend is not registered into IS, also reduces the value of the investment account. 
	- Basically dividends are expensed? 
- profit or loss would be registered in the income statement, along with the amortised value of the non-current assets. 

## Notes: 
### when the value of the proportional loss is higher than the value of the investment account. 
- Investment account is set to 0. 
- The corresponding amount is considered as loss in the income statement. 
- The remaining loss is recorded as unrecognised loss, to be recovered in future. 
- In future, when associate makes significant profit, first unrecognised losses are cleared and then the remaining amount is entered as income in the IS. 

## How good will is calculated. (Excess purchase price.)
- The difference in the book value of the associate and the proportional amount paid for the share is called excess purchase price. 
- The proportional difference in book value and fair value is kept in the investment account as excess allocated to non-current assets, which is amortised regularly. 
-  The remaining amount is accounted as goodwill, which is checked for impairment on regular basis.
