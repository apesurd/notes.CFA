1. Growth rate will move towards its [[SteadyState]] regardless of the initial K/L or T
2. In the [[SteadyState]], $g^8$ (growth rate in productivity) is a function only of the growth rate of tech and labor's share of total output.
3. [[CapitalDeepening]] can only affect the level of output, but not the growth rate in the long run.

1. Long term sustainable growth cannot rely solely on [[CapitalDeepening]] investment.
2. Only way to sustain growth in productivity is through *technological advencements*
3. This results in upward shift in the production function.

1. Growth rate of developing countries should exceed those of developed countries.
2. Predicts a convergence over time.

1. Increase in savings/investments will only temporarily raise economic growth.
2. The [[SteadyState]], $G^*$ does not depend on the percentage of income saved or invested. 
3. Countries with higher saving rates will have a higher (Y/L) and higher (K/L)
