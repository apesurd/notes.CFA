Is a tool used by policy makers to determine the policy rate to achieve the dual objective of:
1. Price Stability 
2. Maximum sustainable level of employment. 

Central banks use target inflation rate and estimate of potential GDP of the economy. 

$$ 
 \begin{split} 
 Policy \; rate & = \\
	 & ST \; real \; rate \\
	 & + Expected\; inflation \; (\theta) \\
	 & + 0.5(\theta-\theta^*) \\
	 & + 0.5(Y - Y^*)
 \end{split} 
$$
	where $\theta^*$ is target inflation and $Y^*$ is log of potential output. 

ST real rate: rate the balances long-term savings and borrowings.

If inflation and/or output is higher than the target, the policy rate should be increased to dampen economic activity.
