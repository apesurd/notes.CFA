Authorized Participants serve mainly as market makers for ETFs.
Manages ETF shares inventory, Underlying securities inventory and cash according to the anticipated demand and supply of the ETF shares. 

If supply is more than demand: 
	APs buy ETFs shares from the market and corresponding on the collected shared redeem UL securities from the issuers, based on the redemption basket and redemption units. 

If demand is more than supply 
	APs would ask issuer to create more ETF shares based on the creation unit and creation basket. APs exchange UL securities for ETFs.

Thus APs act as [[Arbitrageur]] for ETF shares. 

- Redemption Basket can be different from Creation Basket to save taxes. 

ArbitrageurGap is the difference between the bid and ask price of an ETF share. 
This depends majorly on the liquidity of the ETF, and/or some of its underlying securities, service cost, transaction costs etc. 
Minimally this gap should be wide enough to recover the cost of APs.
