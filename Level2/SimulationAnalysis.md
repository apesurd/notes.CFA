Tests a strategy for a scenario but the data used is randomly sampled, rather than what actually happened in history. 

Data can be samples using:
1. Historical Sampling 
2. Monte Carlo methods 

While working with Monte-Carlo analysis, the analyst should consider the correlation of the key factors. i.e. Consider multivariate distribution instead of univariate one. 
Also consider the tail correlation, which would be present in the multivariate distribution. 

Sensitivity analysis usually accompanies simulation analysis. 
>[!Note] This is different from [[SensitivityAnalysis]] 

Change in the distribution of the target variable, in response to the changes in the distribution of the key variable.
