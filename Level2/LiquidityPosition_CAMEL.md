Having adequate liquidity is important for the bank to avoid bank-run. 

- [[BASEL3]] introduced 2 minimum liquidity standards: 
1. [[LiquidityCoverageRatio]]
2. [[NetStableFundingRatio]]

>[!Tip]
>How much we have over how much is expected. 
>For both of the above measures, min. requirement is 100%. 

Other liquidity metrics recommended by [[BASEL3]] are: 
1. Concentration Ratio: High value suggest reliance on few funding sources, which can be risky, (lack of diversification)
2. Maturity mismatch:  asset maturities differ significantly from maturity of the funding sources. Higher the mismatch, higher the liquidity risk for the bank. 

Banks usually try to borrow at short term rates and lend at long term rates, which can expose them to liquidity risk, and liquidity crunch in case they are unable to roll over its short-term borrowings.
