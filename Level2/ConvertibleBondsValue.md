Value of convertible bond = Value of call on stock  + Straight Value 

**Conversion Value**: Value of stock received if converted. 
> Conversion ratio * stock price

> [!Note] Different from conversion price. 


At any point, the min value of the bond would be higher of conversion value and straight value.

Investors are willing to pay higher than the conversion ratio for downside protection, also less volatile, while participating in equity upside 
	Though in doing so they also lose a part of upward profit.

Premium over straight value: can be used as a measure of the downside risk. It's flawed however, as straight value can vary with changes in market interest rate and credit quality of the issuer. 

Even if the stock price remains the same, the bond holder would keep on getting paid the coupons.
