#BigData 

README files usually contain information about the data being used.

External data can be fetched through APIs or through web crawling.

Sourcing from vendors can have the following downsides:
1. Comes with a price
2. During the cleansing process, on vendor's end, some information might be lost
3. If there are many users for the same data, the information edge might be lost.
