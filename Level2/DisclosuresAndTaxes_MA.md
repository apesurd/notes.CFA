## Foreign exchange gains and losses 
1. Even if a parent has multiple subsidiaries, FX gains and losses are required to be stated a single line (as aggregate amount) in IC (FX gains/losses) or in BS (as [[CTA]] ).
	- The breakdown might be included in the Disclosures, though not mandatary. 

1.  Pose a challenge for the analyst when 2 parents in the same industry use different standards or different methods. 
	- [[CleanSurplusAccounting]] can be one of the possible adjustments for comparing financial statements. 
 
## Sales Growth 
- When sales growth from various subsidiaries are aggregated in the consolidated BS, there is no way of directly knowing that how much of the growth is organic and how can be attributed to the change in FX rates. 
- Companies often report effect of FX changes in MD&A section of their annual reports. 

## Foreign Exchange Risks 
Reflect the effect of Fx rate changes on asset and liabilities of the business and on the future of sales. 
- Disclosures in MD&A may contain: 
	- Impact of currency value changes on profits. 
	- Also check whether any hedging tool is being employed by the company to manage it's exposure to currency risk. 
	- Can use sensitivity analysis to further the analysis. 
## Tax Implications 

- Accounting standards require companies to provide a reconciliation between [[StatutaryTaxRate]] and [[EffectiveTaxRate]]. 
- This disparity is due to a few items, including: 
	1. (+) Effect of disallowed expenses. 
	2. (-) Effect of exempted income. 
	3. (+/-) Effect of taxes in foreign jurisdiction. 

- Reconciliation disclosures can help analysts to project future tax expense.
