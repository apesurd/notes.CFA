1. Subjectivity 
	1. Based on the discretion of analysts, the measure can differ. 
2. Assumption of normality, won't hold, resulting in under calculated VaR, as in general return distributions tend to have fatter tails. 
3. Failure to take into account liquidity. When market is in distress, securities might be traded at a steep discount. 
4. Underestimation of correlation. Overestimation of diversification benefits -> underestimates magnitude of potential losses. 
5. Risk of misinterpreting.
6. Only considers potential losses, while ignoring potential gains.
