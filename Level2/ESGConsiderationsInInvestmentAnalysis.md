## Dispersed vs concentrated 

% ownership is not always a reliable indicator of concentration of control. 
- Can influence control using Horizontal business arrangements, vertical business arrangement or dual class share. 

### Concentrated
- Globally concentrated structure is common. Shareholders can be: 
	- Family
	- Group of companies 
	- Sovereign entity 
- e.g. China, India, France, South Korea, Singapore, etc. 

### Dispersed 
- Numerous shareholders, with none having control. 
- e.g. Australia, Ireland, UK, US, etc. 

### Hybrid 
e.g. Canada, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, etc. 


## Conflict 

|   |Concentrated Ownership| Dispersed Ownership|
|---|---|---|
|Concentrated Voting Power|Principal-principal conflict^[Major shareholders make decisions at the expense of minority owners]|Principal-principal conflict (Indirect control^[Control is gained based on other factors mentioned in the above section])|
|Dispersed Voting power|Using [[VotingCaps]]|Principal^[shareholders in this cash]-agent^[manager in this case] conflict|



## Influential shareholders 
How the following type affect corporate governance risk: 

### Banks

- Benefit: 
	- Principle-agent conflict may be reduced. 
- Drawbacks: 
	- Difficult to recruit quality outsiders 
	- lack of transparency 
	- lack of accountability
### Government/SWF
- Useful if the firm:
	- is of strategic importance 
	- Produce essential goods 
	- requires high capital
- Management needs to:
	- provide social benefits 
	- while ensuring returns to shareholders. 

### Institutional Investors 
- Includes: 
	- Insurance companies 
	- Pension funds 
	- Mutual funds 
- Collective investment can represent a large portion of equity ownership. 
-  Have considerable resources and expertise, can exert influence on management to act in the benefit of shareholders. 

### Group companies 
- Cross holdings based on horizontal or vertical ownership structure. 
- Might lead to related-party transactions, which may not be beneficial for shareholders. 
### Private Equity Firms 
- Invests in private companies or in public companies with the aim of taking them private. 
- Can exert influence by introducing:
	- Performance based compensation 
	- Corporate codes. 

### Foreign Investors

- Standards would improve (for a company based in EM) if it is to be listed in a developing market country. 
- Minority shareholders stand to benefit from improved standards of governance 

### Management and BOD
- If management and BOD owns shares in the firm, then their interests become aligned with the other shareholders.
- This can boost productivity over long-term. 
- One might argue, though, that they might value their own interest rather than those of other shareholders. 

## Factors affecting Corporate Governance 
### Board Structure 
- Can be :
	1. OneTier: Internal (executives, from firm) and external directors (not part of management) at the same level
	2. Two-Tier: Non-executive directors supervise Executive directors (Management board). e.g. Germany, Russia, Argentina, etc. 
	   - Supervisory board performs the following function: 
		   - Determine management compensation 
		   - Supervise external auditors 
		   - Review financial records 
### Director independence 
- Independent directors are non-executive directors with no other relationship with the company. Should not have:
	- Significant renumeration 
	- Ownership 
	- Employment relationship (with the firm)

### Special Voting Arrangements 
- In order to counter principal-principal conflict, some countries provide special rights to minority shareholders to nominate/elect board members to look after their interest. 

### Corporate Governance codes, laws, and listing requirements 
- Some countries have mandated "Comply or Explain" Code which require firms to:
	- either adopt best corporate governance practices 
	- or explain why the best practices are not adopted. 
- In some countries, objective is achieved through COMPANY LAW, or stock exchange LISTING REQUIREMENTS. 

### Stewardship codes 
Are voluntary codes to encourage shareholders to exercise legal rights and increase level of engagement. 
- In some countries, (UK), they are entirely voluntary where institutional investors are required to: 
	- Monitor companies 
	- Publish "Comply or explain" statement
