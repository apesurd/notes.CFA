The relationship between GDP growth and prices of fixed income securities is not very straightforward like [[ImpactOfGDPGrowthOnEquity]]

It can be affected by 5 factors:
1. Inflation rate: Inflation $\uparrow$ => bond prices $\downarrow$
2. Real interest rates: directly proportional
4. Credit risk: Increase in GDP reduces credit risk
5. Monetary policy: IR $\uparrow$ => bond prices $\downarrow$
6. Fiscal policy: If fiscal policy is expansionary chance of default reduces and thus less yield
