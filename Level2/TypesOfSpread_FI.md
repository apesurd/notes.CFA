The difference b/w bond yield and benchmark yield (i.e. spread) consists of other factors too besides credit risk, though the major contribution is from credit risk. 

Other factors can likely be: 
- Liquidity premium 
- Tax premium 

> [!Note] for CFA L2, we focus only on CVA or credit spread only.
