Under Capital Asset Pricing model stock's expected return can be modelled as following 

$$
R_f + \beta \; ERP + Unsystematic \; risk \; premium 
$$
	where ERP stands for *Equity Risk Premium*

When this is applied on a well diversified portfolio, the unsystematic risk component can be neglected and return can, thus, be calculated using the following equation 

$$
E(R_p) = R_f + \beta_p \; ERP
$$
	where $\beta_p$ is the Sensitivity of the portfolio return to $\Delta ERP$
