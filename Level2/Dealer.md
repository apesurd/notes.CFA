Provides liquidity by the virtue of availability to the sellers and buyers in the absence of any counterparty. 

Very important for infrequently traded securities like bonds. 

When dealers buy/sell, they increase/reduce their inventories. 

Profits by selling at ask prices which are higher than the bid prices when they buy.
