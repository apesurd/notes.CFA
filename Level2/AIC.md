#Regression 

## Akaike's information Criteria


- Used to evaluate model fit.
- Evaluates a collection of models that explain the  same dependent variable.
- Preferred if the purpose is prediction.

$$
AIC = n\; ln (\frac{Sum\; of\; squares\; error}{n}) \; + \; 2(k+1)
$$
- Goal of the multiple regression is to derive the best fitting model without adding any extraneous independent variables. Hence AIC is a measure of model parsimony.
- Lower the AIC, better fitting the model is.
