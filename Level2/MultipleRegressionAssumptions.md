#BasicsOfMultipleRegressionAndUnderlyingAssumptions #Regression 

## Assumptions of multiple linear regression model
1. **Linearity**
	   Relationship b/w the dependent variable and independent variables is linear.
	   
2. Homoskedasticity
		Variance of regression residuals is the same for all the observations
	   
3. Independence of errors
	   Observations are independent of one another. i.e. regression residuals are uncorrelated across observations.
	   
4. Normality
	   Regression residuals are normally distributed
	   
5. Independence of independent variables
	   a. Independent variables are not random.
	   b. There is no exact relationship b/w two or more of the independent variables or combinations of the independent variables.
