Investor has influence but not control over investee. 
- Generally 20-50% ownership interest 

The influence can be in the form of: 
- Board of Directors representation 
- Involvement in policy making 
- Interchange of managerial personnel 
- Material intercompany transactions 
- Technology transfers 

Accounting method used is [[EquityMethodForAccounting]]

> [!Note]  [[GAAP]] (all entities) and [[IFRS]] (VCs, MFs, Unit trusts, etc) both give investment an option to choose FVPL method as well. Choice must be made at initial recognition and is irrevocable. 

## FVPL method 
- BS contains the fair value of the security. 
- Unrealised and realised G/L are recognised in the IS, along with the dividends received. 
- Income statement of the associate does not affect the value of investors BS directly. 
- Excess of cost over investees identifiable net assets are not capitalised. Hence goodwill is also not created. 

## Issues 
### Impairment 
Since equity method is based on the historical cost and subsequent financial performance of the associate, carrying value of the investment may not be an accurate reflection of its fair value/stock price. 

In cases where associate is cooking its books or something similar, therefore both [[IFRS]]  and [[GAAP]] require periodic review of the impairment, and "impairment loss" must be recognised in the income statement and investment account value is reduced to fair value of the investment in the associate. 

Under IFRS, investor has a choice either to reduce the value to fair value directly or using an allowance account. 
- Along with this [[IFRS]] also requires evidence of one or more loss events, and that these loss events have impact on future cash flows. 

Reversal of the losses is prohibited even if the fair value later increases. 

### Transactions with Associate 
1. Downstream transactions: Investor to investee. 
   - Profit from the sale is reduced by the proportion of the goods not sold by the investee. 
2. Downstream transactions: investee to investor.
   - Investor should eliminate proportional share of profit that is unconfirmed from equity income, as unrealised profit. ( #Q)
   - Investee can recognise the profit in his IS though. 
Profits from transactions with associates can't be realised until confirmed through use or sale to third parties. 

## Challenges for analyst. 
1. Check whether equity method is appropriate: Degree of influence is the main criteria not ownership interest. 
2. Are investor's margins and ratios skewed? Net profit margin can also be overstated. 
	   Since net assets contribute to investors investment account, this can skew debt ratios.  
3. Consider the quality of equity income. If associate is showing higher earnings but no dividends, then investor might be able to report higher earnings cash flow may not increase correspondingly.
