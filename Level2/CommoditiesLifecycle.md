Supply and demand factors analysis is done using: 
1. Direct announcements by govt. or private agencies
2. Seasonality
3. Macro-economical factors (Low IR -> increased spending -> increased demand)

- 6 classes of commodities
## Energy
- Crude oil, natural gas, and refined products 

### Stages 
1. Extraction 
	1. **Oil**
		1. Storage (some crude is stored as strategic reserve)
		2. Refined (Gasoline, Heating oil, Diesel oil, Jet fuel)
			- Refining low-grade (high supply) crude oil is costlier than processing lighter varieties.
			- Refineries are costlier to construct
		1. Consumption 
	2. **Natural gas** 
		Natural gas is either supplied for consumption through pipes (which are again costlier to build like refineries), or can be cooled to liquid form and transported on ships. 

### Factors affecting supply 
1. Economic and political costs of access 
2. Discovery / depletion of oil fields. 
3. Refinery technology and maintenance 
4. Pipeline and tanker reliability 
5. Geopolitical instability 
6. <font style="color:green">Environmental Regulations</font>
### Factors affecting demand 
1. Seasonality 
2. Adverse weather 
3. Economic growth 
4. Commuting trends 
5. <font style="color:green">Environmental Regulations</font>

## Metals 
Both types involve very similar lifecycle. 
1. Extracting ore 
	Hard to decrease production (even if the price falls) as it characterises economy-of-scale. i.e. Mined acerage and smelting capacity is more or less fixed. 
1. Smelting (in qualities that user need)
2. Storage 
### Industrial 
- Aluminium, Nickel, zinc, lead, tin, iron, copper, etc.
- Demand depends on GDP growth and business cycles.
### Precious metals 
- Gold, silver, platinum, etc.
- Usually inflation hedge. 
- Demand depends on monetary policy and geopolitics. 
## livestock
- Life of different type of livestock may be different
	- Chickens: weeks 
	- Pig: 6 months 
	- Cattle: Few years 
- Supply depends on:
	1. Weather conditions 
	2. **Price of grain**
	3. Diseases 
- Demand depends on income growth (in developing countries)

## Grain
- Essential for subsistence 
- Offset of 6 months for cultivation in north and south hemisphere. 

- Supply depends on: 
	- Weather 
	- Diseases 
	- Pests 
- Demand is usually stable and predictable.
## Softs
- Luxurious crops, also known as cash crops. 
- Coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton.
- For coffee there is significant gap b/w investment and supply (usually 4 years)  
- Supply is affected by: 
	- Weather 
	- Disease 
- Demand depends on :
	- Income growth in developing countries 
	- Consumer preferences.
