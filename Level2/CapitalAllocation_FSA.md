## EBIT Margin
- Breakdown the revenue based on the business divisions. 
- Compare the same with EBIT.
- Based on both of them calculate the [[EBITMargin]] 

## CapEx 
- Compare Assets and [[CapitalExpenditure]] of the company within each segment. 
- Ideally higher the assets, higher the CapEx. 
- CapEx% / Asset% greater than 1 implies that the firm growing the corresponding segment. 

## Conclusion 
Business, ideally, should be pushing more capital to the division with higher margin. 
	(This was not the case in the case-study though.)
