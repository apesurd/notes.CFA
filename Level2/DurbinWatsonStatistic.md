DW statistic is a test for autocorrelation in the residuals from a statistical model or regression analysis.

Value would lie between 0 and 4. 

A value of 2.0 would indicate there is no autocorrelation detected in the sample.

Greater than 2.0 implies negative correlation
Less than 2.0 implies positive correlation.
