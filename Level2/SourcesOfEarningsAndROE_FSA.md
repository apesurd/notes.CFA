Based on [[DuPontAnalysis]], ROE can be decomposed into: 
1. Tax-burden 
2. Interest burden 
3. EBIT margin 
4. Total Asset turnover 
5. [[Leverage]] 

> [!Reminder] 
> Based on the example, where Net income one-line consolidation from associates (equity method), we deduced total assets but didn't change leverage
> -  That is because, we don't know how the associates were financed, so we assumed the same leverage ratio.
