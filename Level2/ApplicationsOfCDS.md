1. Managing Risk exposure 
	   - Managing credit exposure to a risky bond. 
	   - For the seller, it would present an opportunity to earn the credit spread without buying the underlying bond (Which would require more capital)
		   - Also since CDS is much more liquid than bond, the position can be unwound much more quickly. 
	   - Sellers exposes themselves to a significant amount of credit risk though, as in case a credit event occurs, the premiums received are not sufficient to cover. 
		   - Dealers handle this by selling CDS to multiple buyers (to diversify the credit risk) 
		   or short the underlying obligation (Hedge)

One can buy or sell CDS without owning the underlying obligation, such contracts are called "Naked CDS"
CDS Buyer is expecting that credit quality will go down, and hence the credit spread will go up.
