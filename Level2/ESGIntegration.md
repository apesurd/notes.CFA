#issCorp #ESGConsiderations 

## ESG definition 
3 key themes (i.e. Environmental, Social, and Governance) in measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of an investment.

ESG Investing: Consideration of ESG factors when identifying companies to invest in.
- Also broadly known as "sustainable" or "responsible" investing 
- Invest in companies that efficiently manage their environmental, human capital, and financial resources to generate attractive long-term profitability. 

### Environmental factors 
1. Natural resource management 
2. Pollution prevention 
3. Water conservation 
4. Energy efficiency 
5. Carbon assets 
6. Adherence to environmental standards 

### Social factors 
- Human rights and welfare concerns in the workplace 
- Staff development 
- Employee diversity 
- Impact on the community. 

## Identifying applicable factors 
Materiality^[impact on share prices, operations, other financial aspects] of the ESG factors differ among sectors. 
- In manufacturing industry "environmental" factors would play a major role. 
- In finance industry, "Social" aspect would relatively be more dominant.

Investment horizon should be considered, as some factors would have different short term and long term implications.  

### Publicly-available filings/publications 
- Financial reports 
- Govt filings 
- press releases. 

#### Challenges 
1. Information and metrics inconsistently reported. 
2. Disclosures are voluntary, level of transparency varies. 
3. Identify the information which is relevant and useful. 

### Approached used to identify relevant factors 
1. ESG data providers 
2. Proprietary methods
   - Use information from data providers 
   - using proprietary tools 
   - 10-K regulatory filings 
   - corporate sustainability report 
   - annual reports 
3. Industry organisations:
   - Organisations/initiatives to standardise ESG related metrics to improve comparability 
   - These organisations include: 
	   - IIRC ([[InternationalIntegratedReportingCouncil]])
	   - Global Reporting Initiative: Has worked with stakeholders to develop sustainability reporting standards.  
	   - Sustainable Accounting Standard Board: Promote uniform accounting standards for sustainable reporting. Has developed a SASB materiality map.  
> [!Note] Lack of standardisation creates comparability issues 

## ESG Integration 

ESG factors integrated into traditional security and industry analysis. 
Answer the following questions: 
1. Risks and Opportunity arising from ESG factors. 
2. Management of ESG resources in sustainable manner.   

Firms projected financial statement are adjusted after taking into account the relevant ESG factors. 
- e.g. Effect on revenue, cost, earnings, CapEx is estimated. 
- BS: adjustment in value of assets to reflect impairment. 

ESG factors also affect the valuation of firms fixed income and equity. 
- Fixed Income analyst usually focus on downside risk e.g. Lawsuits, [[StrandedAssets]], [[GreenBond]] etc.
- Equity Valuation: Both upside and downside is considered.
