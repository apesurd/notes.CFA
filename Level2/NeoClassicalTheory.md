[[Cobb-DouglasProductionFunction]] is the heart of NeoClassical Growth theory.

Primary focus is to determine the Sustainable Growth rate (LT [[SteadyState]] growth rate.)


![[LabourProductivity]]

Impact of capital deepening is more for developing markets in contrast to the developed markets, this explains the higher growth rates in developing nations than that of developed nations.

Population growth is independent of GDP growth.
Growth is achieved through technological advancements. 
## Sustainable growth rate of output per worker
Defined by growth rate in tech / labour's share of GDP
$$
g^* = \frac{\theta}{1-\alpha}
$$

## Sustainable growth rate of output
$$
G^* = g^* + \Delta L
$$


## Shortcoming
- Does not explain TPF
- TFP is considered exogenous
