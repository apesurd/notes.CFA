#issCorp #CorporateRestructuring 

Main task to model: 
- Pro-forma financial statements 
- pro-forma WACC 

## Proforma financial statements 
Financial statements are updated based on the the type of corporate restructuring . 
Refer: [[IntercorporateInvestments]] 

## Proforma WACC 
- After [[CorporateRestructuring]] [[WeightedAverageCostOfCapital]] may change. 
- This can be due to change in:
	- Proportion of debt and equity. for example
		- debt-financed acquisition 
		- cash from divestiture used to retire debt
	- Rate of equity or debt. Hard to estimate but in general can be affected by 
		- $\Delta$ Profitability (EBITDA/Sales, EBIT/Sales) 
		- $\Delta$ Volatility of earnings (std of revenue, std of EBITDA)
		- $\Delta$ Leverage (Debt/EBITDA)
		rate of debt can also be lowered if collateral is being is to raise debt. 

- Investor grade investors pay attention to their investment grade rating. 
- Lowering of rating (i.e. below BBB) can significantly increase their WACC. 
	- Therefore corp. restr. decisions are geared toward the maintenance of investment-grade rating.
