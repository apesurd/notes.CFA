#FSA #CorporateInvestments 

When investor does not have significant influence on investee. 
- Generally less than 20% 
- Considered passive investment 

Accounting methods: 
This nomenclature is meant for IFRS, the equivalent name under GAAP is in enclosed brackets. 
1. Amortised cost  (Held to maturity) (Not ever applicable for equity since they don't mature)
2. Fair value; through p/l ([[HeldForTrading]])
3. Fair value; through OCI ([[AvailableForSale]])

Accounting are explained under IFRS9 standards. 

See [[IFRS9ProvisioningModel]] 
## Debt Securities

Note: Regardless of the method used, interest income is calculated using the amortised value of the debt instrument. Same goes for the amortised premium/discount. 
Amortised premium = coupon - Interest income 

>[!Remember]
> Coupons are not considered as income, we use the interest as income (yield * prev price)
> Unrealised gains and losses are not considered in amortised cost method. 
> ! How do you calculate amortised discount. [[CalculatingAmortisedDiscountOrPremium]] 


> Unrealized gains/losses = Change in fair value + amortised prem. - amortised discnt

## How do decide which method to use: 
1. Use [[BusinessModelTest]]
2. Use [[CashFlowCharacteristicsTest]]
If both tests are successful then Amortised method can be used. 
- But in case it's clear that the security is held of trading and to avoid [[accountingMismatch]] FVPL and FVOCI can also be used. 

If the answer to the test is NO, then 
	if the security is held for trading then use FVPL otherwise one can choose either FVPL or FVOCI.

Reclassification is allowed if the business model changed, i.e. the objective of holding has changed which affects the business operations significantly.
Restatements of the prior periods is not allowed. 
- When a bond is reclassified from AMC to FVPL, BS value is set to the current FV and in IS "revaluation loss/profit" is entered. 
- When a bond is reclassified from FVPL to AMC, FV of the reclassification date becomes the carrying amount. Bond is amortised using this carrying value forward. 

## Equity securities 
Since equities don't mature they can't be amortised, and hence amortised cost method isn't used.

- If the security is held for trading then use FVPL otherwise one can choose either FVPL or FVOCI. (same as Debt)
- Reclassification of accounting method is not permitter under IFRS.

## Derivatives 
Should be measured usually using FVPL. 
But for hedging instruments where the fair value can be measured in OCI. 

If an asset has embedded option, like convertible bonds, FVPL should be used.
