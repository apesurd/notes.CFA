#fixedIncome #arbitrageFreeValuationFramework 

Doesn't take into account uncertainty of interest rates in the future. 

	BECAUSE

Future cash flows for OPTION-FREE bonds are not affected by changes in interest rates. 

This framework won't work for the valuation of bonds with embedded options though, as its exercise depends on the price of the bond, which in turn depends on the interest rates.
