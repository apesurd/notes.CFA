Earnings are made up of cash-flow component plus accrual. 
- Higher amount of accrual implies less persistent / low quality earnings. 

## Accruals / NOA calculation 
NOA -> Net Operating Assets. 
Lower ratio -> higher quality 
### Balance sheet approach 
Accruals are calculated as change in net operating assets over a period. 
NOA = 
	Operating Assets (i.e. Total Assets - cashNEquivalents - Marketable securities)
	- Operating Liabilities (i.e. Total liabilities - LT debt - ST debt)

Accruals = $NOA_{end} - NOA_{bgn}$
2 * Avg. NOA = $NOA_{end} + NOA_{bgn}$

### CashFlow approach 
Only Accruals calculation would be different, Avg. NOA calculation would be same. 
$Accruals_{CF}$ = Net Income - CFO - CFI 

- CFF is not excluded because most financing cashflows don't flow through income statement. 

>[!Note]
>Accrual calculations through both methods may differ because of acquisitions and divestitures, exchange rate g/l and inconsistent treatment of specific items between BS and CF statement. 


## Warning signs 
Need further investigation for checking whether earnings are manipulated. 
- Increasing levels of accruals 
- Wide fluctuations 

### Approach 
- Companies operating cash flow should be in line with EBIT (i.e. operating income)
- But we can't directly use CFO, as it includes interest and taxes outflow, therefore interest and taxes should be added back to the CFO. 
	- We call this figure, CGO (i.e. Cash Generated from Operations)
	- Ratios should be greater than 1 to check off earning manipulation possibility. 

### Other figures 
1. Cash return on total assets 
   - CGO / Avg total assets 
   - Cash generated for each dollar of asset. 
2. Cash flow to reinvestment 
   - CGO / Capital Expenditure 
   - Sufficient resources to fund company's capital expenditure. 
3. Cash flow to total debt 
   - CGO / Total Debt 
   - Would company face any difficulty in meeting its debt obligations 
4. Cash flow interest coverage 
   - CGO / Cash Interest 
   - Can interest be covered by cash flow.
