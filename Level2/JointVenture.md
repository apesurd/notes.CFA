In some cases of a [[BusinessCombination]], control is shared by 2 or more investors, this is known as a joint venture. 

E.g. Say a foreign company wants to buy a local company but due to local laws can't, in that case it can partner up with another local company to buy the target as joint venture. 
Sometimes this can also be done to manage risk exposure from the target. 

- Remain three distinct entities after business combination. 

- Both [[IFRS]] and [[GAAP]] require [[EquityMethodForAccounting]] for accounting in JointVentures. 
- In some rare cases, [[ProportionateConsolidationMethodForAccounting]] is also used.  

> [!Reminder] Total assets, total liabilities, revenue, expenses are reported higher in [[ProportionateConsolidationMethodForAccounting]] then in [[EquityMethodForAccounting]].
> Though, total equity and net profit remains the same.
