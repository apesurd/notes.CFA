 Callable bonds are bonds with an embedded call option, which gives the issuer the right to call back bond prior to maturity. 

The Issuer would want to do that in cases where Market IR is lower, to refinance their debt at a lower cost. 

There is usually a provision of the "protection period", during which the bond can't be exercised. 

Based on exercise dates: 
1. European : single day after the protection period 
2. Bermuda: Some predetermined fixed dates 
3. American : Anytime after the protection period. 

>[!Note] [[PutOption_EO]] don't usually have American style put options embedded in them. 


If callable bonds has call-price set to par, then its max value would be par.
