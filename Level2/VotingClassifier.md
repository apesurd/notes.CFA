#machineLearning 

- Majority vote classifier (applied on [[EnsembleLearning]] based models) will assign the predicted label with most votes

  The more individual models you have trained,  the higher the accuracy of the aggregated prediction.

There is an optimal number of models beyond which performance would be expected to deteriorate from overfitting. The trick is to look for diversity in the selection of algos, modelling techniques and hypothesis.
