Likelihood of default in a PARTICULAR year. 

If [[HazardRate]]  is 0.4 percent, then probability of default at the end of year 2 is $(1 - 0.4) * 0.4$, i.e. probability of surviving the first year times hazard rate. 

in general, probability  of default 
$$
(1-HR)^T
$$


## Probability  of Survival 

$$
(1 -HR)^{T-1} * HR
