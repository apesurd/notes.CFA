#portfolioManagement #measuringAndManagingMarketRisk

 Measure of downside risk of a portfolio. 
 Three components to describe the VaR:
 1. Minimum loss 
 2. probability of incurring the minimum loss 
 3. time horizon 

Usually measured with 1%, 5% and 16% (1 std away from mean). 


Key methods to estimate VaR of a portfolio:
1. [[VaRParametricMethod]]
2. [[VaRHistoricalSimulation]]
3. [[VaRMonteCarloSimulation]]

Regardless of the method used, the steps involved in calculating VaR are as follows:
1. Identify risk factors 
2. Gather historical data
3. Estimate VaR
