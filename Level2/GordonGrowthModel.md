#EquityInvestements 

- Assumes constant growth rate of dividends. 
- Using current dividend, const. growth rate and required rate of return, value of the company can be calculated. 

$$ 
V_0 = D_0(1+g) / (r - g)
$$

- If next periods dividend is known. 
$$
V_0 = D_1 / (r - g)
$$

## Assumptions 
1. Dividends are correct metric for valuation purposes. 
2. g is forever constant 
3. r is forever constant 
4. r is greater than g. 

## Characteristics 
- As the gap b/w g and r widens, the value of the company reduces. 
- The equation involves 4 variables, using which we can calculate: 
	- implied required return^[Assuming market price as value]
	- Implied growth rate^[Assuming market price as value]
- Growth rate (i.e. g) also implies growth rate in: 
	1. Dividends 
	2. Value 
	3. Earnings (assuming const. payout ratio) 
- See [[JustifiedPERatio]]
- See Valuation of [[PreferredStocks]]

## Advantages: 
1. Valuation of stable, mature and dividend-paying firms. 
2. Valuation of market indices, determine [[ImpliedGrowthRate]], [[JustifiedPERatio]]s and [[PVGO]], [[ImpliedRequiredRateOfReturn]] 
3. Straightforward, therefore can be easily communicated and explained. 
4. Can be used to supplement other, more complex valuation methods. 

## Disadvantages 
1. Cannot be easily applied to non-dividend paying firms. 
2. Valuations are very sensitive to estimates of g and r. 
3. Unpredictable growth patterns may result in unreliable valuations.
