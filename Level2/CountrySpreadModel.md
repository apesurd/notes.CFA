ERP = $ERP_{Dev}$ + $\lambda$ CRP 
where: 
	CRP is Country Risk Premium.

- $\lambda$ refers to the exposure of the company to the emerging market. 
- CRP is calculated using Sovereign bond yield spread. 
	- i.e. Yield on EM bonds (in DM curr) - Yield on DM gov. bonds
	- PROBLEM: we are using bond rates from different markets to calculate country risk premium. The difference might be due to differences in legal and market environments among countries. 
	- Damodaran's refinement adjusts this value. 

## Damodaran Refinement 
CRP = Sovereign bond yield spread * ${\sigma_{equity{EM}}}/{\sigma_{bond{EM}}}$
