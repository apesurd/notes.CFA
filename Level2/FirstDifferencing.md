#TimeSeries 

The transformation is called first-differencing when it subtracts the value of the time series in the first prior period from the current value of the time series. 

$$
y_t = x_t - x_{t-1} = \epsilon_t, \; E( \epsilon_t ) = 0, E(\epsilon_t^2) = \sigma^2, \; E(\epsilon_t\epsilon_s) =0\; if \; t \neq s
$$

The first differenced series for a random walk is [[ CovarianceStationarity  |covariance stationary]]
