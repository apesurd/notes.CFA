## Effect on EPS and BVPS 

### Cash dividends 
- Cash leaves the BS -> Assets and Equity is reduced by the same amount. 
- EPS remains the same. 
- BVPS reduces since total equity is reduced but shares remain the same. 

### Stock dividend 
- No cash leaves BS. 
- Shareholders wealth remains unchanged too. 
- But each share is now worth less. 
- EPS and BVPS would reduce. 

### Share repurchase (thru cash)
- Cash leaves the BS. Assets and Equity is reduced by the same amount. 
- Shares repurchased are kept in companies treasury and not considered for future dividends, votings or for calculating EPS and BVPS. 
- EPS would increase. 
- BVPS would:
	- increase: if repurchase price is lower than current BVPS 
	- Decrease: If repurchase price is higher than current BVPS. 

### Share repurchase (thru new debt issuance)
- Equity is traded off in favour of increased liabilities 
- EPS would: 
	- Decrease, if [[EarningYield]] is lower than after-tax cost of debt interest. 
	- Increase, if [[EarningYield]] is higher than after-tax cost of debt interest 
- Leverage ratio increases 

## Effect of shareholders wealth 
- Assuming capital gain tax == tax on dividends 
### If repurchase price is equal to the market price. 
- Shareholders wealth would remain the same for share repurchase and for cash dividends. 

### If RP is higher than the market price. 
- Shareholders wealth would be less after share repurchase than cash dividend payment. 
- Market price of stocks after share repurchase may increase though, due to increase EPS and other factors suggesting positive outlook for the company. But that effect is not quantifiable. 



## Common Rationale (over dividends)
1. Potential tax advantages. 
   - If tax on capital gains < tax on dividends 
2. Support share price / signalling. 
   - Would work better if there is information asymmetry. 
   - Convey confidence in investors
3. Added flexibility in earnings distribution 
   - Share repurchases don't have long-term commitment, unlike dividends. 
   - Fluctuating dividends have negative effect on the share price. 
   - Company can vary distribution based on the cash flow. 
4. Offset dilution from employee stock option. 
5. Increase leverage to accomplish firm's target capital structure.
