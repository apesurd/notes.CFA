#issCorp #AnalysisOfDividendsAndRepurchase 

## Classical Theories 
### Doesn't matter 
**Modigliani-Miller theory**: Dividend policy has no effect on the price of a firm's stock or its cost of capital 
- Holds in perfect world assumptions 
	1. No taxes 
	2. No brokerage costs 
	3. Infinitely divisible share 
- Investors can make their own dividends  
- Dividend policy has no effect on company value if all clienteles are satisfied.
### Matters 
#### Bird in hand 
By **Gordon-Lintner**. 
- Based on "A bird in hand is worth two in the bush"
- Investors value dividends more than expected capital gains. 

- So div. paying firm would have lower cost of equity and thus higher stock price.
- MM refutes this argument by stating, that by paying dividend today does not affect the risk of future cash flow, this only lowers ex-dividend price of the stock.

#### Tax aversion 
- Generally dividends are taxed at a higher rate then capital gains. 
	- That's why investors would prefer lower dividends. 
	- In some countries, there are constraints on accumulating excess earnings. 
 
Change in ex-dividend stock price 
$$
\Delta \text{Stock price} = Dividend * \frac{1 - T_D}{1 - T_{CG}}
$$

## Other perspective 
### Clientele Preference 
Varying different preferences for different types of investors. 
1. Individual investors 
2. Institutional investors (For legal / strategic reasons)
3. Investor's tax bracket. 

### Signalling 
Information Asymmetry: Management has more insights and information on the company's growth prospect than the other stakeholders. 
- Dividends give important signals to the market. 

- Companies tend to keep the dividend ratio stable, i.e. sticky. 
	- Company growing dividend -> Sign that company is doing good / potential for growth 
	- Company reducing dividend -> Sign that company is not doing good. 
		- Though it can also mean that a new investing opportunity has come up. 


- For companies that have never paid dividends before, this can be taken as:
	- NEGATIVE: Company has no avenues to put in the extra money. 
	- POSITIVE: Company is optimistic about the future and is sharing its wealth with stockholders. 
### Agency costs 
Reflect inefficiency due to conflict of interests between various stakeholders of the company. 
- Managers are incentivised to take on more risk to grow the company whereas the shareholder bear most of the risk. 
	- To reduce AC, to increase payout of free cash flow as dividends, with less cash management would be picky with projects, hence taking less risk. 
- Bw shareholders and bondholders, When risky debt is outstanding shareholders would want to get dividends, so the asset base as collateral would reduce for the debt holders.
	- Though there can be provisions in bond indenture to avoid this.
