# Types
## Global CAPM

Used for calculating ERP for the global companies 

Instead of local market, an index representative of the global market is used. 

$\beta_G$ : Company's relationship with the local economy relative to the global economy. 
- Lower value implies lower integration with global economy. 

## International CAPM 
$$
r_e = r_f + \beta_G * ERP_{Global} + \beta_C * ERP_{Curr}
$$
Takes into account the foreign currency risk 
$beta_C$ measures the sensitivity of the company's cash flows to changes in its local exchange rates. 

# Drawbacks 
- $\beta_G$ can be very low or even negative due to the low correlation between developed and emerging markets. 
- Use only if company operations are limited to developed markets.
