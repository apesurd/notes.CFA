## Determination of highest loan 
- Following 2 ratios are used to calculate the max loan 
1. [[LoanToValueRatio]] : Max is set 
2. [[DebtServiceCoverageRatio]] : Min is set (usually 1.25 to 1.5) to make sure NOI is enough to cover  debt-service. 

- Based on the amount calculated based on the above criteria, the lower amt. is the max loan which can be taken. 
- Limits vary according to the risk profile of the property, and regulatory requirements. 

##  ![[EquityDividendRate]] 
### Calculate IRR when property is sold 
IRR can be calculated using the calculator. 
Using 
- Equity amount as PV
- regular cash-flow (NOI less debt-service^[for interest-only loan]) as PMT 
- {Sale price - principal} as FV
- N as the time period
