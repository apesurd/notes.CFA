Solow's approach (Growth Accounting Relation)

$$
\frac{\Delta Y}{Y} = \frac{\Delta T}{T} + \alpha \frac{\Delta K}{K} + (1- \alpha)\frac{\Delta L}{L}
$$


$\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}$:  Growth rate in potential GDP
$\frac{\Delta T}{T}$: Long term growth rate of technology (Also known as total factor productivity)
Long term growth-rate of capital
Long term growth-rate of Labour
