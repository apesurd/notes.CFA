Excess return for a long term bond for 1-period wrt short term gov bond (1 period risk free rate)

Also known as term-premium or duration-premium. 

Expected 1-period return is related to LT bond yield, but not necessarily equal. 
## Factors explaining: 
### ST and MT yields 
Majorly explained by Inflation, and remaining variation explained by economic growth and monetary policy. 

### LT bond yields
Majorly explained by monetary policy and remaining explained by inflation. 
No contribution from economic growth. 

> [!Note] This is in contradiction from volatility in ST and LT bond yields.


## Effects of Monetary policy 
[[BullishSteepening]]
[[BearishFlattening]] 

Changing benchmark rates have limited impact on LT rates.

In the aftermath of 2008 and 2020, central bank bought back [[TBonds]], and MBS (known as quantitative easing) leading to fall in the LT interest rates as well. 

## Effects of Fiscal Policy 
During recession, central bank tends to keep the interest rate low, but govt would want to stimulate the economy by borrowing by issuing bonds.
This would lead to increase in the supply of the bonds and would effectively increase the interest rates. 
If govt. issues only LT bonds, this would lead to increase in the yields of LT bonds only

## Effects of investors demand 
Pension funds and insurance companies use long dated govt bonds to match liabilities . 
Greater domestic demand raises price of the LT bonds and reduces yield. 

During uncertain economic times, investors tend to get rid of highly volatile assets and buy less risky ones. This phenomenon  is also known as "flight to quality"
If investors flock to buy LT bonds, this would lead to steepening of the yield curve. 
Also known as [[BullishFlattening]]

## Investor Actions 
Investors usually use futures to reduce portfolio turnover. 

If investor is expecting the yield to decrease, then they would extend duration to take advantage of the rising prices. 

Otherwise, if investor is expecting the yield to increase, then they would reduce the duration to reduce exposure to falling bond prices. 

### Capitalise on steeping yield curve 
Short LT bonds and long ST bonds. 
If durations are matched (duration neutral), investors are not impacted by any parallel shift in the yield curve. 
The portfolio would profit if yield curve steepens and would face a lose otherwise. 

### Capitalise of flattening of the yield curve 
Long LT bonds and Short ST bonds, maintaining neutrality in the duration. 

### Strategies for LONG only managers. 
1. Bullet strategy : Gain exposure to a particular key rate. (Target duration of the portfolio) 
2. Barbell strategy : Create using a combination of shorter dated and longer dated bonds. If bullish flattening is expected then this strategy would take advantage of the risking price of the longer dated portfolios. ****
