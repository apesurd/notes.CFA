Like all dealers post quotes to profit from bid-ask spread. 

Dealer profit depends much on the volume of trade. 

Maintain low-inventory of actively traded securities and update this on the basis on the market information. 

They often monitor news feed and suspend their quotes when important news is about to be released. 
- This results in lost trading opportunities, in case the news is immaterial, but protect the dealer by honouring trades at stable / predictable prices.
