### Core investing style

1. Office 
2. Industrial

### Non-core

- No fixed leases and highly correlated with business cycles. 

## Return drivers 
- Have both bond and stock like characteristics 
- Regular income during the lease period. 
- When lease expires there is uncertainty around the cash flows going forward, which depends on the condition of the economy. 
	- Makes it somewhere between bond and stocks. 
### Types of leases 
#### Offices

2. [[NetLease]]

- Rent for [[NetLease]] is usually lower than [[GrossLease]] 
- Common clauses in the lease agreement:
	- [[TripleNetLease]]
	- [[SaleLeasebackPeriod]]

#### Retail 
- **Percentage lease**: Additional rent on sales above minimum rent

- Demand and supply of tenants affects the rental income 
- Less operating expenses, debt repayments, capital spending (for upgrading)
- Whatever remains is the return of real estate which is paid to the investors.
