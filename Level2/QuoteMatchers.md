Are kind of [[ParasiticTraders]]

Quote matchers use their knowledge of standing limit orders as options to trade while limiting their risk. 

## Strategy
- Looking at the standing orders, pick a security with minimum bid ask spread (and other parameters like volume). 
- If price rises then keep the profit, and if it falls then the loss would be contained based on the spread, due to upstanding market order.
