#EquityInvestements 

EV measures a company's total value, i.e. the value an investor needs to pay to buy off all common and preferred stocks, debt less the value of cash and highly liquid securities. 

> [!Note]
> Market value is used for valuation, not book value. 

EV can be negative, if the value of its cash and cash equivalents surpasses the combined total of its equity and debt. It's a sign that company is not using its assets very well. 

> EV = common stocks MV + preferred stocks MV + Debt MV - (Cash + ST investments)

If market value bonds not available: 
- Compute the proxy using market value of comparable bonds. 
- Use book value, if market conditions (since the issue) haven't changed much. 

- EV / Sales is a better estimate then P / Sales, as NOT all sales belong to shareholders. 
- EV / EBIDTA is another ratio, represents the earnings to both shareholders and creditors. 
	- Useful measure when comparing companies with varying capital structure.
