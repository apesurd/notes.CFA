## Characteristics (4Vs):
1. Volume: size of the data
2. Velocity: How quickly data is communicated
3. Variety: Varying degree of structure in which the data can exist.
4. Veracity ^[optional, if data is required for making inferences] (Validity)

## Main steps in building ML models with structured data
1. Conceptualisation of the problem
2. [[StructuredDataCollection|dataCollection]]
4. [[DataPreparationAndWrangling]]
5. [[DataExploration]]
6. [[ModelTraining]]


## Step in building ML models with textual data
1. [[TextProblemFormulation]]
2. [[TextCuration]]
3. [[TextPreparationAndWrangling]]
4. [[TextExploration]]
5. Model training
