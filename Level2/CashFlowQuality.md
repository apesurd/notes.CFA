- In early stages of the company. 
	- CASH INFLOW: highest for CFF 
	- CASH OUTFLOW: highest for CFO 

- when the company becomes stable: 
	- CASH INFLOW: highest for CFO 
	- CASH OUTFLOW: not the different but generally highest for CFF(Pay off debt, pay dividends).
	- For CFI (mainly related to capital expenditure)

## Manipulation 
### Delaying payment periods. 
- By selling off receivables, firms can increase cash inflow.
- By choosing to delay payments to vendors (thus increasing payables) firms can decrease cash outflow. 
- Both are not sustainable. 

- Watch out for increasing [[ReceivablesTurnover]] and decreasing [[PayablesTurnover]]

### Aggressive accounting 
- Generally CFO should increase with earnings. 
- If earnings are increasing while CFO remains const. It can be a sign of aggressive accounting. 
	- Recognising revenues too soon. Or delaying expenses recognition. 

### Misclassification of cash flow. 
- CFO is considered a stable source of future cash flow, so companies may try to inflate it by shifting some components from CFF and CFI. 
- Under US [[GAAP]], 
	- Interest received and dividend received are treated as CFO 
	- Interest paid is treated as CFO too. 
- Under [[IFRS]], however, 
	- Interest received and dividend received can be treated either as CFO or CFI. 
	- Interest paid can either be treated as CFO or CFF. 
	- To inflate CFO, companies may choose to include Interest received and dividend received as CFO, but interest paid as CFF. 
		- It's not exactly misclassification but analysts should look out for this, when comparing reports using IFRS. 

- Cash flow from Sale of Available-for-sale securities is considered CFI. 
- Cash flow from Sale of trading securities is treated as CFO. 
- Management has thus incentive to reclassify securities to increase CFO.
