If the yield curve is upward sloping with short term rates near zero (as it was after 2008 financial crisis) then active fund managers can borrow in short term to buy long term bonds. 

This however exposes investors to interest rate risk, in case interest rates keep on increasing while traders are holding on to the bonds would generate losses.
