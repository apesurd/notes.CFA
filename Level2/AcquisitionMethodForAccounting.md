- Investee and Investor are required to file a consolidated financial statements. 

### Assumptions
- all assets and liabilities are identifiable and fairly valued
- Acquirer paid for the net assets at fair value. 

## Balance sheet 
- Shareholders are paid cash, thus assets of the investor would be reduced by the equivalent amount. 
- After this all assets and liabilities are added together. 
- In case the ownership interest is not 100%, proportional share of the remaining equities is kept as "Minority interest" as equity 

## Income statement  
Assumption: no goodwill created in acquisition process. 
- Revenue and expenses are added together. 
- Proportion of profit owed to minority shareholders is deduced. 

## No assumptions 
To account for the differences in the fair value of the assets and liabilities, and premium paid by the acquirer to acquire, we create goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Two options: 
1. Full goodwill 
   > Fair value of entity as a whole - fair value of all "identifiable" assets and liabilities 
   Minority interest = Fair value of the subsidiary * MI
- Fair value of the subsidiary depends on the sale price. 

2. Partial goodwill : 
   > Fair value of the acquisition - fair value of all "identifiable" assets and liabilities acquired
Minority interest = Fair value of identifiable net assets * MI
- Fair value of identifiable net assets depends on the net sum of subsidiary assets less liabilities 


`Partial GW = Full GW * %acquired`
US [[GAAP]] requires full goodwill. 
[[IFRS]] allows both. 

Assets, Equity (Full GW) >= Assets, Equity (Partial GW)

All identifiable assets and liabilities are carried over, at fair value, to parent's BS. 
- Good will is added 
- Minority interest is added. 

> [!Note] In rare scenarios where purchase price is less than fair value of net assets acquired, no good will is created. and the difference is recorded in IS.
