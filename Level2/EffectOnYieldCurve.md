[[TermSpread]] is usually positive, hence [[YieldCurve]] is normally upward sloping. 
This may be because of the premium related to uncertainty in longer maturity bonds. 

Slope of the yield curve can change due to the expectations. 
When central bank raises the policy rate to lower inflation, [[TermSpread]] would decrease. 
LT inflation expectations also falls. 

Yield curve inversion or flattening, would reflect expectations of lower GDP growth and inflation. It is often perceived as a predictor of recession. 

Don't read too much into the yield curve as it reflects a complex mix of interest rate expectations and risk premium considerations. 
It can also be affected by market forces of demand and supply. 

In case of economic turmoil, investors would flock towards more stable bonds and thus decreasing the yield.
