When forward exchange rate is higher than the spot rate then we say that there is premium, and discount for the other way round.

> Forward premium/discount = (Forward rate) / (Spot rate)  - 1


## Annualisation of the discount/premium 
ann premium/discount = prem./disc. * 360 / {number of days in the future contract}
