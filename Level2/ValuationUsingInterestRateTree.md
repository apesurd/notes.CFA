[[InterestRateTreeCalibration_FI]]

After stripping we break down the possibility of interest rate into two possible outcomes, which are 2 standard deviations (of IR) away from each other. 
$$
IR_{up} = IR_{dn} \; * \; e^{2 \sigma}
$$

If the interest rate tree is correctly calibrated, the value of the bond (without any embedded options) would be same as obtained from [[ValutionUsingSpotRates_FI]]
