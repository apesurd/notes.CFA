$$
\begin{split}
P = GDP * \frac{E}{GDP} * \frac{P}{E} \\
\Delta P = \Delta GDP * \Delta (\frac{E}{GDP}) * \Delta (\frac{P}{E}) \\ \\

\text{In long term, latter two expressions would equate to 0}\\
\text{therefore the equation woudl reduce to} \\ \\

\Delta P = \Delta GDP 
\end{split}
$$
The above equation is not applicable in short term.

**Growth in aggregate stock market prices has to match the growth in potential GDP.**
