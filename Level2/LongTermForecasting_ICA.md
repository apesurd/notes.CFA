- Forecast horizon selection is done so that it is in conjunction with the investment strategy. 
- Horizon should be long enough to include the middle of the business cycle. 
- Also should be able to wait to realise the benefits of acquisitions or restructuring.

1. Consider normalised earnings: 
	- Absense of: 
		- Effects of business cycle. 
		- Recent MnA activity 
		- Restructuring activity 
		- One-off event. 
2. Revenue projections 
	- there is a likelihood of overestimating revenue projections 
	- Better forecast can be made using normalised revenue trend. 
3. Cash flow projections. 
	1. Need [[TerminalValue]] calculation too.
