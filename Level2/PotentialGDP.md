#Economics 

Potential GDP = Size of labour force x [[LabourProductivity]] per worker

Potential GDP = Size of hour worked x Labour productivity per hour


## In terms of growth

Growth in potential GDP = Growth in labour force + Growth in labour productivity

HENCE
`Sustainable Growth rate = Labour force growth rate + Labour productivity growth rate`
