Introduced later to address some of the shortcomings of structural models. 

Default intensity: Prob of default in the next (small) time increment
- Can be estimated using: 
	  1. Company ratios: leverage, income to assets, cash to assets ratio, etc
	  2. Macroeconomic variables: unemployment rate, GDP growth rate, etc.
	     Allows the model to reflect the business cycle in credit risk measure. 

## Advantage 
- Do not rely on balance sheet. 
- Do NOT assume traded assets. 

## Disadvantages 
- Do not explain why default occurs, instead statistically predicts when default occurs. 
- Default in RF models are randomly occurring exogenous variable 
- But default is likely a surprise, as they are often preceded with rating downgrades. 

## Used by/for 
- Value debt securities and credit derivatives.
