CapEx are funds used by a company to acquire, upgrade, and maintain physical assets such as property, plants, buildings, technology, or equipment. 

- CapEx are payments made for goods and services that are recorded or capitalised on a company's balance sheet instead of expensed on the income statement. 

If an item has a useful life for less than a year, it must be expensed on the income statement, rather than capitalised, which means it isn't considered CapEx.
