In some countries (mainly in Europe), financial companies issue covered bonds, in which [[Collaterals]] pool is known as the covered pool. 

They are similar to ABS with differences being: 
- Assets remain on the BS of the originating firm.
-  No SPV is created 
- Covered pool is bankruptcy remote, even if the assets are on firms balance sheet. 
- Provides protection to their investors. 
- Originating firm is required to replace/augment the non-preforming assets in the covered pool, so that all the obligations to the investors are met. 
- In case a payment is missed, investors have two options: 
	- hard bullet: bond default is triggered and bond payments are accelerated
	- soft bullet : extend the maturity of the pool upto one year and payments are not immediately due
