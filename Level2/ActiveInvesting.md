## Active ETFs
Managers don't have the discretion over security selection 
Based on pre defined rules for allocation and selection. 

1. Factor (Smart Beta) ETFs
	1. Benchmarked to index, created with predefined rules, for selecting and weighting constituent holdings. 
	2. Can be single factor or multi factor. 
	3. Risk in multifactor is usually lower than single factor, but we lose the upside as well.
