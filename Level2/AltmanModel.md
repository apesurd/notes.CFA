Assess probability that a firm would file for bankruptcy. 

z-score = 
	 1.2 Net working capital / Total assets 
	 + 1. 4 Retained earnings / Total assets 
	 + 3.3 EBIT / Total assets 
	 + 0.6 Market v. of Equity / Book v. of liabilities 
	 + 1.0 Sales / Total assets 

A higher value of z-score would indicate lower change of bankruptcy.
