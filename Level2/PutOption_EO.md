Putable bond is a bond with an embedded put option, that gives the right to the investor to put back the bond prior to maturity at a predetermined put price. 

Investors would want to exercise the put option when the IR are high, so that they can invest the proceeds at higher interest rates. 

Like [[CallOption_EO]], Putable bonds also have "Protection period".

Unlike [[CallOption_EO]] though, there are not american style putable bonds. Mainly they are european style, and rarely based on bermuda style. 

If Putable bond has put-price set to par, then its min. value on exercise dates would be par.
