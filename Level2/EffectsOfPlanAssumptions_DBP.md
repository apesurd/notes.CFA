#FSA #employeeCompensation 

We study the effect of the following: 
1. Discount rate^[Based on interest rates of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity profile similar to the future obligation] 
2. Salary growth rate 
3. Expected rate of return on assets. 

On: 

> [!Note] Past Service cost remain unaffected by the terms of the plan.

## PBO
1. $\uparrow$ DR would lead to decrease in Current Service cost and actuarial (gains) component, but increase in Interest gained (on PBO beginning)
   - Cumulatively PBO would **DECREASE** though. 
2. $\uparrow$ SGR would lead to increase in CSC and AC (loss). 
   - Overall PBO would **INCREASE**.
3. $\uparrow$ Expected ROA would have **NO EFFECT** on PBO 
## [[FundedStatus]]
PA are priced at fair value, and using actual rate of return, so there would be no effect on them. 
And since funded status implies PA less PBO, we can simply reverse the signs. 
1. $\uparrow$ DR  => INCREASE FS
2. $\uparrow$ SGR  => DECREASE FS
3. $\uparrow$ Ex ROA  => NO EFFECT on FS
## TPPC
Since TPPC is "Current contribution less change in funded status", the effects would be opposite to that of funded status or similar to PBO. i.e.
1. $\uparrow$ DR => DECREASE TPPC
2. $\uparrow$ SGR => INCREASE TPPC
3. $\uparrow$ Ex ROA => NO EFFECT on TPPC
## Periodic Cost on IS
Similar to that of TPPC only, with some caveats. 
1. $\uparrow$ DR would lead to decrease in CSC and increment in Interest cost. AC are recorded in IOC. 
   - Generally the decrease in CSC would dominate the increment in interest cost, hence DECREASED PConIS.
   - But it can also INCREASE, when PBO value is high enough (near maturity) to dominate decrement in CSC. 
2. $\uparrow$ SGR => INCREASE 
3. $\uparrow$ Ex ROA => DECREASE (as per US [[GAAP]] )

| Effect on | $\uparrow$ DR | $\uparrow$ SGR | $\uparrow$ Ex ROA | 
| ------ | ------------| ------ | ------------|
| Pension Obligation | $\downarrow$ | $\uparrow$ | NA |
| Funded Status | $\uparrow$ | $\downarrow$ | NA |
| TPPC | $\downarrow$ | $\uparrow$ | NA |
|PPC on P&L | $\downarrow$^[might increase on majurity]  | $\uparrow$ | $\downarrow$ |
