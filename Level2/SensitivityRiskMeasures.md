#portfolioManagement #measuringAndManagingMarketRisk 

An investment portfolio generally consists of three kind of assets: 
1. Equity 
2. Fixed income securities 
3. Options 

## Equity sensitivity 
$\beta$ is a measure of stock returns sensitivity to the market's systematic risk. 
Higher value of beta would indicate that the security is more  risky than the overall stock market itself. 

## Bond sensitivity 
*[[Duration]]* and Convexity can be used to calculate the sensitivity of a bond wrt to YTM (interest rates)

$$
\Delta price = - duration \; \Delta Y + 1/2\; convexity \; (\Delta Y)^2
$$

## Option sensitivity 
[[Delta]], [[Gamma]] and [[Vega]] together can be used as sensitivity measures of options. 
$$
\Delta Option \; value = delta \; \Delta S + 1/2\;gamma\;(\Delta S)^2+ vega\; \Delta V
$$
