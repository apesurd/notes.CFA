#Economics 

A model to express economic growth.
Also known as Solow model.

$$
G_{GDP} = G_{tech.} + w_l * G_{labour} + w_c * G_{capital}
$$

where $w_l + w_c=1$ 
	$w_c$: labour % share of national income
	$w_c$: Capital % share of national income

For developed economies, $w_c < w_l$, so investments in physical capital is less effective for economic growth.


## Per capita GDP
Growth in per capita GDP = Growth in technology + $W_c$ * (Growth in capital to labour ratio)

## Explanation of Business Cycle
- Ideally BS should not exist, as there is tendency towards full-employment total equilibrium.
- But technology can deviate the AD curve to the left and hence deviation from the equilibrium. With time though, as unemployment leads to lowering of wages, equilibrium is achieved again.
- As market forces themselves can themselves correct business cycle deviations, govt. intervention is not needed.
