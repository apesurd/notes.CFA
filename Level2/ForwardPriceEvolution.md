Using [[ForwardRateModel]] , we can express it as a geometric mean of the spot rates and the subsequent forward rates for each following year. 

Using the rates from above process, we would be able to calculate the forward price evolution for the bond.

Note: 
- If spot rates go as forecasted by the forward rates, the realised gain should be the same as the expected gain.

- But if spot rates are lower than what's predicted by the forward curve then the return on the bond would be higher than expected.
