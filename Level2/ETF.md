Exchange Traded Funds are similar to [[IndexMutualFunds]] as they aim to replicate the returns of a benchmark index.
Difference lies in the method of creation and redemption of shares. 

[[ETFandIndexMFDifferences]]

NAV of an ETF can deviate from the value of the portfolio when demand is not equal to supply. To address this issue, the ETF issues designates [[AuthorizedParticipants]] as the market maker. 

NAV of the ETF is not affected by the transaction cost. 
In ETFs the transaction costs are passed on to the investors who are actively trading an ETF share, long term investors are not affected by it. 
This is unlike MFs where every investor is affected by the transaction costs of the underlying securities and transaction costs are deducted from the NAV. 

- Incurs low cost for issuers 
- Tax efficiency, by keeping low basis stocks as part of the redemption basket. Resulting holdings have higher cost basis, resulting in portfolio's unrealised gains.
