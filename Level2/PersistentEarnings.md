- Use regression model to gauge earnings persistence. 

## Models 

### Using past earnings data 
$$
Earnings_{t+1} = \alpha + \beta_1 Earnings_t + \epsilon
$$
If $\beta_1$  high -> future earnings consistent with current earnings -> high earnings persistence. 

[[AccrualAccouting]] leads to subjectivity because of many estimates and judgements involved with assigning revenues and expenses to appropriate periods. 
### Using cash-flow plus accruals 
- Enhanced model 
$$
Earnings_{t+1} = \alpha + \beta_1 CashFlow_t + \beta_2 Accruals_t + \epsilon 
$$
- Research has shown $\beta_1 > \beta_2$ -> cashflow component is more persistent. 

- Relative proportion of accrual component wrt cash flow is an important indicator of earnings quality. 

- Specifically analysts need to pay attention to discretionary (Abnormal) accruals, from non-normal transactions/accounting. 

- Analyst should also compare the accrual share wrt the industry average. 

## Mean reversion of earnings. 
- Increase in Accrual component of the earning accelerates earnings mean reversion .
