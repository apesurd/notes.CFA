#Economics 

Based on [[MalthusianEconomics]] ; 
	focusses on growing population in a world with limited resources.

Key Assumption: Diminishing marginal returns to labours. 

Per-capita income converges to *subsistence income*. 
- If income $\uparrow$ more than SI, then population growth will accelerates. 
- Opposite is true when income $\downarrow$ 
- Thus, long-term growth in per-capita GDP is not possible

In other words, increase in capital and TFP leads to larger population
	But increase in output does not lead to richer population.


DOES NOT HOLD TRUE:
- As many countries have achieved growth in per-capita income in long term.
- Population growth does not always accelerates as per-capita income increases. Opposite is true, e.g. Japan, etc.
- **Rapid technological progress** more than offset the impact of diminishing marginal returns.
