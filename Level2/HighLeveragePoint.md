#Regression 

## Definition
an observation with extreme value of an independent variable

## Measurement
- Measure of finding high leverage points is *leverage* ($h_{ii}$)
- Higher the leverage, higher the chance of that observation to be influencial.
- Distance b/w the value of the *i*th observation of that independent variable and the mean value of that variable across all n observations
- The value of leverage lies between 0 and 1. 

If leverage is greater than $3\frac{k+1}{n}$. then we consider the data point as *high leverage point*.
