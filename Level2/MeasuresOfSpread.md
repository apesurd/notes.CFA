## Swap Spread
- As LIBOR swap curve represents risk of A1/A+ banks, it would lie above Gov bond yield curve (risk free)
- The difference between the swap rate and govt. bond yield with the same maturity is the swap spread. 
- Represents perceived credit risk relative to risk free rates. 
- Higher spread during recessions and lower spread during expansion, thus denoting counter-cyclicality. 

## I-Spread
- Difference between the yield of a bond wrt to the swap curve for the same maturity. 
- Measure of the credit risk and liquidity risk of risky bond. 

## TED Spread 
- Treasury bills, and European Dollar futures spread. 
- Amount by which inter-banking rate exceeds the ST US Govt. Debt
- Difference b/w 3 month LIBOR SPOT rates  and 3 month T-bill rate. 

> [!Note] It's the LIBOR spot rate not swap rate. 

## LIBOR-OIS Spread 
- Difference b/w LIBOR and Overnight Index Swap rates. 
- OIS: Interest rates on unsecured *overnight* lending between banks, therefore indicative of risk free rate not interbank lending rate. 

## G-Spread

- Difference in the yield of Bond's YTM and Govt. bond yield
- Doesn't take into account the shape of the yield curve

## Z-spread
- Delta on the govt. bond spot rates to calculate the value of the bond. 
$$
Price = \frac{C}{1+S_1+z} + \frac{C}{(1+S_2+z)^2} \frac{C+N}{(1+S_3+z)^3}
$$


- Also known as the zero-volatility spread.
