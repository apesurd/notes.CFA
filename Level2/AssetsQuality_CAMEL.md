## Composition 
### Loans

- Reverse Repurchase Agreements: A form of collateralised loan

### Securities 
- Measured either using Amortised cost, fair value (thru PnL) or fair value (thru OCI)
- Assets held for sale: discontinued operations whose value is driven mainly by their intended disposition. Not to be confused with available for sale securities. 
### Others (Liquid)
- Cash and Equivalents. 
- Deposits in other banks. 
- Govt. Securities. 

## Credit risk
- Risk of default on loans and for debt securities. 
- Also present in off-balance liabilities like unused lines of credit or letters of credit. 

- Most banks provide disclosure stating the state of the asset quality ranging from strong to impaired, along with the allowance for loan losses. 
- This enables the analyst to access the credit quality of the assets by proportion, and also how they change over time.
