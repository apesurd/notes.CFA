#commoditiesDerivates 

Unlike stock/bonds there is **no cash flow** from the underlying and there are costs associated with transportation and storage. 

## Definitions 
- [[Basis]]
- [[CalendarSpread]]

- [[Contango]] 
- [[Backwardation]]


## Theories of futures returns. 
### 1. Insurance theory 
- Seller requires insurance for the price of the crop, therefore the buyer would have more negotiating power. 
- Explains [[Backwardation]] 
- BUT many markets are not in [[Backwardation]] and buying futures has not resulted in extra returns for the buyers providing "insurance"

### 2. Hedging pressure theory 
Opposing forces from producers and users 
- Both users and producers face uncertainty. When user's hedging dominates, then we observe [[Contango]], and vice-versa 

- BUT both users and producers may be speculators in the market, not just hedgers. 
	- Producers have more motivation to hedge, as the risk is concentrated. 
	- There is no way to measure the hedging pressure. 

### 3. Theories of storage 
- Long should compensate short for storage less benefits (convenience yield) of holding the underlying. 

- In case of [[Contango]], benefit for holding the commodity today is less then holding it in the future. And vice-versa.
