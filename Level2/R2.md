#Regression 

- Coefficient of determination, or R2 or R-squared.
- Measure of the goodness of fit of an estimated regression to the data.

$$
R^2 = \frac{Sum\; of\; squares\; regression}{Sum\; of\; squares\; total} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{Y_i} - \overline{Y})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \overline{Y})^2}
$$
	where n is the number of observations in the regression, $Y_i$ is an observation of the dependent variable, $\hat{Y_i}$ is the predicted value of the dependent variable based on the independent variables, and $\overline{Y}$ is the mean of the dependent variable.
