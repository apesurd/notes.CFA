#FSA #IndustryAndCompanyAnalysis


 - Financial modelling begins with income statement. 
 - This is logical because company derives most of their value from the income generated by the business. 

## Income statement Modelling 

### Revenues 
1. Understand segment of revenue 
- Break down the sources of revenue by 
	- Geographical source 
	- Business divisions 
		- In case different divisions operate in different industries. 
	- Products Line 
		- Small number of products that behave differently, but account for most of company's sales. 

2. Forecast future revenue based on segment 
	1. Top-down approach 
		1. Based on GDP growth 
		2. Based on market and  market share growth  
	2. Bottom up approach 
	3. Hybrid approach  

### Operating Costs 
- Involves COGS, SGnA and depreciation expenses. 
- Like revenue, an analyst can take top-down, bottom-up or hybrid approach. 

#### Check: Business has economies of scale (EOS) 
i.e. cost per unit productions reduces with the amount of sale. 
- One way for checking that can be to compare the IS of the company with a much larger company in the same industry (in the same business)
	- If operating income is higher in proportion of sale, EOS is present

### COGS 
=> 1 - Gross margin 
Estimate it using the ratio GOCS / Rev. 
	1. We can forecast COGS using revenue, by using the ratio. 
	2. Pay attention to the gross margin as well and investigate. 
	3. Compare it with industry wise margins too. 

As COGS is usually the largest component in the IS, paying attention to the price and volume of the inputs would improve the quality of the financial statements. 
- especially in the short run. 
- Check if any inputs are hedged

### SGnA 
Made up of: 
1. (More) Fixed cost: 
	1. Rent 
	2. salaries 
	3. IT operations
2. Variable cost (i.e. changes with sale)
	1. Selling and distribution 

SGnA for each segment can be evaluated and aggregated to get a better estimate. 


### Depreciation 
Non-cash expense 
Forecast based on historical depreciation, and company disclosures about depreciation schedule. 

### Non-Operating Costs 
#### Financing cost

Interest Income is little for manufacturing companies, but significant for financial companies. 

Net Interest Expense rate and Gross Interest Expense rate can be used to forecast future finance cost. Taking into account: 
	- Planned debt issuance/ retirement 
	- Maturity structure of existing debt. 

##### Income Tax Expense 
Three Tax types 
1. [[StatutaryTaxRate]] 
2. [[EffectiveTaxRate]] : Can be useful for projecting earnings 
3. [[CashTaxRate]] : Can be useful for projecting cash flows. 

Pretax income should be normalised to exclude contributions from associates and special items. That would give a better estimate of pretax-income.


### Dividends 
Can be modelled using forecasted net income. 
- based div payout ratio  and dividend policies of the firm. 




## Balance Sheet 
### Retained Earnings 
NI - Dic = $\Delta$ RE 

### Working capital 
Accounts receivables, accounts payables, and inventory can be estimated using the information from IS. 
- A common way is using efficiency ratios 
	- Sales / [[ReceivablesTurnover]] for receivables \ 
	- COGS / [[InventoryTurnover]] for inventory 
	- Purchases / [[PayablesTurnover]]  for payables 
### Net PPnE 
Less directly tied to IS for most companies. 
1. Assume Historical PPE / Revenue remains unchanged. 
2. [[CapitalExpenditure]]  - Depreciation = PPE 
   - Both above are forecasted figures. 
   - CapEx should include maintainance Capex and growth Capex. 

### Capital structure. 
- Ratios like debt-to-equity, debt-to-capital and debt-to-EBITDA can be useful for projecting ST debt, LT debt and owner's equity. 

## Once statements are prepared. 
Once all fin. stmts. are generated, the following figures can then be calculated. 
1. [[ReturnOnInvestedCapital]]
2. [[ReturnOnCapitalEmployed]]

Equity valuation involves significant degree of uncertainty. 
- As it is based on many estimations and assumptions. 
Analyst can use [[SensitivityAnalysis]] for checking how a given assumption affect the financial forecasts. 

- Scenario analysis does the same, but multiple assumptions are changed at the same time.
