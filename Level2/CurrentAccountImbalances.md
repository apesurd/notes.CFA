[[CurrentAccountDeficit]] leads to currency depreciation of domestic currency.
Contrary is true of CA surplus, i.e. currency appreciation.

Mechanisms are as follows:
1. Flow supply/demand mechanism
	   More imports than exports
1. Portfolio Balance mechanism:
	   In case the holders of domestic currency bonds try to sell it as concentration increases, that may lead to decrease in the value of the domestic currency.
3.  Debt Sustainability: 
	   Same as above, difference is in the reason of selling the currency. i.e. unsustainable debt

Currency depreciation than makes imports expensive and exports cheaper thus narrowing the deficit.

## Effect of currency exchange rate on imports and exports depends on:
1. Influence of exchange rates on domestic import and export prices.
2. Price elasticity of demand of the traded goods.
