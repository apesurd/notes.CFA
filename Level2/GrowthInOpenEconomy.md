#Economics 

Removed trade barriers and facilitates free flow of capital can lead to increase in the growth rate of the economy due to:
1. Increased foreign investment
2. Bigger market for the produce, resulting in [[EconomiesOfScale]]
3. Import of technology ($\uparrow$ TFP)
4. Increase competition (Survival of the fittest)
	   Failure of inefficient firms, and reallocation to more efficient use.

- Countries focus on industries where there is competitive advantage.

The predictions are supported by both:
- [[NeoClassicalmodel]]
	- Since ROI in developing countries is higher, it would lead to capital inflow from other countries. 
	- Increased capital inflow would lead to an increase in the growth rate. 
- [[EndogenousGrowthTheory]]
	- Increase in competition, only efficient and innovative firms survive.
	- Enlarged markets. => Higher efficiency/productivity.
	- Imported societal effect

## 2 contrasting strategies for economical development
### Inward oriented policy
Attempt to develop domestic industries by restricting imports and encourage production of domestic substitutes.
e.g. Argentina and Venezuela.
Experience slow GDP growth and convergence does not occur
### Outward oriented policy
Integrate domestic industries with the global economy
Make exports a key driver of growth.
e.g. South Korea, Japan, Singapore, etc.
Converged to the standard of living of the developed countries.
