## Factors influencing big-ask spread 

Reflects marker maker's price for taking the other side of the ETF transaction
1. Liquidity and market structure of UL securities
	1. Say bond usually has a higher spread than a large cap stock. 
	2. Similarly Commodities, Volatility Futures and small cap stocks tend to have wider spreads. 
2. Liquidity of the ETF share itself, say the ETF is thinly traded. 
3. Trading hours of the UL securities

```
Creation/Redemption fees and other trading costs (brokerage, exchange fees, etc)
+ Bid-ask spread of UL securities 
+ Compensation to the AP for taking on the risk of carrying the trade until the close of trading 
+ AP's normal profit margin 
+ Discount based on the probability of receiving an offsetting ETF order. 
```

>[!Note] Market Illiquidity and volatility increase spreads for larger orders. 

## Factors affecting discount/premium 

$$
= \frac{ETF\; Closing \; Price - NAV}{NAV} 
$$

1. Stale pricing 
	1. For infrequently traded ETFs
2. Timing difference
	1. B/w ETF trading hours and trading hours of UL securities 
3. Underlying securities  not exchange traded. 


ETFs are better indicator of underlying value  (in comparison to NAV) when:
- Market for underlying securities is closed. 
- Underlying securities  are volatile or illiquid
