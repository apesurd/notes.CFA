#FSA #employeeCompensation 

`corridor = 10% * max(PBO, PA)`

- Unamortised actuarial losses/gains at the beginning are compared to the corridor. 
- The excess amount is amortised, over the remaining service life of employees, as: 
	- gain: if unamortised gain exceeds the corridor
	- loss: if unamortised loss exceeds the corridor
