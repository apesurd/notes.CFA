Risky corporate bonds would contain more risk than risk-free govt bonds.
To account for this a delta, known as OAS, is added to the interest rate to correctly value the bond. 

Usually the OAS is derived from the market value of the bond, based on the binomial tree. 

OAS corresponds to the credit risk of the issuer. 
Two bonds with similar credit characteristics should be trading at the same price. 

The wider the Market price of the risky bond from it's default-free variant (based on risk free rates), higher the OAS.
