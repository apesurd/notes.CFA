#issCorp #AnalysisOfDividendsAndRepurchase 

Dividing each share into multiple, thus creating more shares. 
- Does not have any effect on the company's capital structure. 

Represented as a ratio. 
- 2-for-1 split would split one share into 2. 
- Worth of each share is also halved. So no change in shareholder's wealth.
