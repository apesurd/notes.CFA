#machineLearning 

Focuses on sorting observations into groups such that observations in the same cluster are more similar (cohesion) to each other than they are to observations in other clusters (separation)

A class of [[UnsupervisedLearning]] algorithm

The onus of establishing "similarity" lies on the analyst, depending on the data and the problem being solved.

There are 2 common types of algorithm used for clustering use cases:
1. [[KMeans]]
2. [[HierarchicalClustering]]
