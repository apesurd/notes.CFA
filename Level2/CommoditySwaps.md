- ADVANTAGES
	- Protection from price risks 
	- Flexibility in taking physical deliveries. 
	- Some degree of customisation is applicable (unlike standard future contracts)

- Opposite end is often taken by a swap dealer, who can less exposure by: 
	- Hedging in future markets. 
	- Negotiating an opposite swap to take delivery (in the future)
	- Offsetting swap with another dealer. 

## Types 

### 1. Total return swap 
- User hedge against the price risk. 
- User pay a constant amount on the notional principle. 
- Dealer pays the return on the underlying commodity index (b/w each period) plus return on collateral on NP. 
- Net is paid. 

### 2. Excess return swap 
- Excess payment when index > threshold. ( (index - threshold) * NP )
- Buyers pays a premium at initiation to compensate seller for taking on the price risk. 
- Can be thought of a series of options with the same strike price.

### 3. Basis swap 
- Return for different underlying is exchanged at each payment date. 
- Help to achieve a more precise hedge against a particular price risk (that is not easily hedged with futures.)
### 4. Volatility and Variance swap 
- Payment is made to the buyer when vol > expected, 
- Payment is made to the seller when vol < expected.
