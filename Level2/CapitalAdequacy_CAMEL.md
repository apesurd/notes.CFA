## Definitions
Proportion of the bank's assets funded with capital.

## TLDR
Three capital adequacy ratios: 
1. Common Equity Tier 1 ratio: [[CapitalAdequacy_CAMEL#Common Equity Tier 1|CommonEquityTier1Capital]] / [[CapitalAdequacy_CAMEL#Risk Weighted Assets|Risk Weighted Assets]]  
2. Tier 1 ratio: [[CapitalAdequacy_CAMEL#Tier1Capital|Tier1Capital]] / [[CapitalAdequacy_CAMEL#Risk Weighted Assets|Risk Weighted Assets]]  
3. Total Capital ratio: ([[CapitalAdequacy_CAMEL#Tier1Capital|Tier1Capital]] + [[CapitalAdequacy_CAMEL#Tier 2 Capital|Tier2Capital]]) / [[CapitalAdequacy_CAMEL#Risk Weighted Assets|Risk Weighted Assets]]  

These three ratio should be greater than a Minimum Capital Requirement set by the regulatory body in line with [[BASEL3]]  guidelines 

## Bank's Balance Sheet 

In a typical bank, primary assets are the loans given to the borrowers and primary liabilities are the deposits from the depositors. 

Other assets are: 
1. LOANS 
2. Securities 
3. Fixed assets 
4. Cash

Other liabilities: 
1. Equity 
2. Debt 
3. DEPOSITS 


### Risk Weighted Assets
Assets in the BS are weighted based on their risk. 
- Non performing corporate loans are highly weighted, followed by performing corporate loans. 
- Mortgages pose least amount of risk as they are usually backed by  [[Collaterals]] 
- Securities also pose risk based on market fluctuations. 
  Generally fixed assets and cash have little to no risk. 

### Bank Capital 
[[BASEL3]] divides bank capital into three main tiers. 
#### Common Equity Tier 1
Common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings, accumulated OCI, less intangibles and Deferred Tax Assets.

#### Other Tier 1 Capital 
Subordinated^[are of lower priority than depositors and general creditors of the bank] instruments with no specified maturity and no contractual dividends. 
e.g. preferred stocks with discretionary dividends. 

### Tier1Capital 
Common Equity Tier 1 + Other Tier 1 Capital 
Usually equivalent to the equity. 

#### Tier 2 Capital 
Subordinated instruments with original maturity of more than 5 years.
