## Averaging price multiples
See [[Price2EarningsRatio]] for issues with averaging price multiples. 


## International considerations 
Comparing companies across countries involve taking into consideration the difference in: 
1. Culture 
2. Economics 
3. Risk and growth opportunity 
4. Accounting. 

- Differences due to accounting are more important for CFA curriculum. 
- US [[GAAP]] and [[IFRS]] differ in how they account for: 
	- Goodwill 
	- Deferred taxes 
	- Forex Adjustment 
	- RnD Expense 
	- Pension Expense 
	- Asset revaluations 
- Price multiples based on accounting earnings should be paid close attention to. 
	- [[Price2EarningsRatio]], [[Price2BookValueRatio]], EV / EBITDA , etc. 
- Cash based multiples are not heavily affected. 
	- P/CFO, P/FCFE, etc. 
- Some companies provide reconciled statements that align with US [[GAAP]], so multiples should be based on them when it's possible.
