## Counterparty risks 

Often times, ETF does not hold the UL securities but get an equivalent exposure to them using derivative contracts (e.g. swaps) with a counterparty. 
This exposes the investors to Settlement risk, i.e. if the counterparty defaults on its obligation. 
To reduce this risk, the settlement is done very frequently, say weekly or daily. 
And majority of the collateral is held in low risk instruments. 

[[ETN]]: Exchange Traded Notes
In case the borrower default on the payment, the issuer may also default on its ETN obligation. 
This risk can be measured using CDS spread of issuing bank

Some ETF lend out securities to short sellers for a fee/interest, thus exposing investors to another counterparty risk. 
This lending usually reduces the cost of operation for the fund. 
The risk is reduced using overcollaterization using securities with minimal associated risks. 

## Fund closures

ETF issuer sells the UL securities and distribute the cash to ETF investors. 
This may have tax implications on the investors. 

### Reasons for fund closure
- Changes in regulation 
- Increased competition 
- Merger and acquisition
- Major changes in the investment strategy. 

**Soft closure** entails creation halt and change in investment strategy. 
Shareholders can retain/trade existing shares in case of soft closure. 
When creation is halted, then ETNs may trade at a significant premium to their NAV. 

## Expectations related risks 
Complex strategies, such as  leverage and Inverse fund, may deliver outcomes that differ from investors' expectations .
Leveraged Fund gets into a swap with 2x Notional NAV with daily reset. 

Leveraged or inverse ETFs are not intended to be buy-and-hold products. Need periodic rebalancing to maintain desired exposure.
