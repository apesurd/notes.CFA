## Credit quality of the [[Collaterals]]
2 key aspects to consider: 
1. Homogeneity: how similar? 
2. Granularity: Number of obligations 

e.g. 
- ST granular and homogeneous (CC receivables)
	- statistics-based approach (book)
- MT granular and homogeneous (auto and consumer loans)
	- portfolio-based approach ( considers changes in the value of the collateral pool overtime)
- Discrete heterogeneous (commercial mortgages)
	- loan-by-loan basis

## Quality of [[Servicer_FI]]
Past history is an indicator of the quality. 

## Structure of the securitised debt 
Many ABS are structured as tranches with varied level of risk and return 

## Credit enhancement
### Internal 
- Overcollaterization 
- excess spread

### External 
- Insurance 
- Third party guarantee 

### Bankruptcy remoteness 
If the originating firm goes bankrupt, then assets are protected from the firms creditors. 
- But if collateral pool fails to perform then holding of the ABS have no recourse from the originating firm.
