## Highlights
1. Balance Sheet:
	1. Monetary assets/liabilities : [[CurrentRate_MA]] 
	2. Non-monetary assets/liabilities : [[HistoricalRate_MA]] 
	3. Common stocks: [[HistoricalRate_MA]] 
2. Income statement:
	1. Revenue, SG&A : [[AverageRate_MA]] 
	2. COGS, Depreciation, Amortisation: [[HistoricalRate_MA]] 
3. Dividends declared: [[HistoricalRate_MA]] 
4. Retained Earnings: 
	   $RE_{end} = RE_{bgn} + NI - Div$
5. FX gains/losses recorded on IS. 

>[!Tip] 
>- RE is calculated by balancing the balance sheet. 
>- The value is then used to calculate the FX gains/losses 
>- No [[CTA]] is required. As FX gains/losses in income statement are expensed. 


## FIFO, LIFO and Average method for [[HistoricalRate_MA]] 
In an inflationary environment without any FX conversion: 

|Method|COGS|Ending Inventory|
|--------|--------|---------|
|FIFO|Lowest|Highest|
|Average|Mid|Mid|
|LIFO|Highest|Lowest|

The same trend would be observed when the exchange rate is increasing, i.e. when the [[LocalCurrency]]  appreciating wrt the [[FunctionalCurrency]] 

- But in case exchange rate is decreasing, we can't say for certain which method would be affecting COGS more. 
	- Depends on whether the price inflation or currency depreciation is more.
