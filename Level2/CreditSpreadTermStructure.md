- Term structure of highly rated bonds would lie below its equivalent lowly rated bond. 
- Difference between the IR term structure of the bonds wrt its common benchmark would give term structure of credit spread. 
- All bonds should exhibit similar characteristics:
	- Seniority
	- Provisions 
	- Embedded options. 
- Generally flatter than term structure of IR. 

> [!Note] Ideally yield of a liquid maturity-matched security is used as benchmark. If not available, it can be linearly interpolated based on the available data. 
> Also swap fixed rates may be used as benchmark (for countries with thinly traded govt bonds)


## Key Drivers 
When viewed through the lens of investors' expectations, [[ProbabilityOfDefault]] and [[RecoveryRate]] are primary drivers of the term structure of the credit spread. 
	i.e. if investors are expecting higher [[ProbabilityOfDefault]] in the future, then term structure curve would steepen. 
	Curve would be flatter if expectations of the future is stable. 

Other than investors' expectations, other key drivers are: 
1. **Credit quality of the bond**: higher rated bonds tend to have flatter TS curve, in comparison to lower rated bonds, as POD not likely to increase with time. 
   In some cases, TS curve can also be negative sloped, if POD increases with immediate economic uncertainty. (e.g. in case of junk bonds.)
2. **Business cycle**: 
   - Spreads are narrower, during expansion 
   - are wider during, recessions. 
3. **Market supply and demand dynamics**. 
   - Freshly issued bonds are more liquid (with larger maturity) in comparison to bonds closer to maturity. TS would be heavily influenced by the bonds which are more actively traded.  
   - Bonds which are liquid tend to have lower bid-ask spread. Such a phenomenon can make spread curve flatter then it should be. 
4. **Equity market volatility**
   - Volatility of the stock market is a determinant for calculating [[ProbabilityOfDefault]] which is positively related to credit spreads. 
   - Thus increase in volatility would lead to higher credit spread.
