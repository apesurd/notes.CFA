#issCorp #AnalysisOfDividendsAndRepurchase 

Price and amount of repurchase is determined by direct negotiation with major shareholders. 

- Can be initiated by the company to prevent
	- an "activist" shareholder from gaining representation on BOD. 
	- an attempt for a hostile takeover. 
- In such cases, shareholder has more negotiating power, and can earn a premium over the market price. 

- If initiated by the shareholder (say in need of money), transaction would take place at a discount.
