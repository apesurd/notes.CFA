> NOPAT - Capital Charge 

Contrast this with [[ResidualIncome]], where the value is calculated only for shareholders. 

> NOPAT = EBIT * ( 1 - T )

> Capital charge = WACC * BV of total capital (for the last year)


## Adjustments done 
1. RnD charges are capitalised and amortised, rather than being expensed. 
2. Charges on strategic investments that will generate returns in the future are added back to NOPAT. 
3. Deferred taxes are eliminated. Only cash taxes should be considered. 
4. Operating leases are treated as capital leases. 
5. LIFO reserves is added back to capital and any increase in the LIFO reserve is added back to NOPAT.
