Relationship b/w interest rate differentials and inflation differentials.

If [[FisherEffect]] holds true, then we can conclude the following:
$$
E(Inf_A) - E(Inf_B) + real_A - real_B = nominal_A - nominal_B
$$

Based on [[RealInterestRateParity]], $real_A$ == $real_B$
which reduce the relationship to: 

$$
E(Inf_A) - E(Inf_B)  = nominal_A - nominal_B
$$

Based on [[RealInterestRateParity]] and ex-ante [[PurchasingPowerParity]]
