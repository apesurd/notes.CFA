Similar to [[EffectsOfPlanAssumptions_DBP]], but SGR is replaced by Healthcare inflation rate. 

Health care inflation rate curve can be characterised by three attributes: 
1. Near term HCIR 
2. Ultimate Health care trend rate 
3. Time to reach ultimate trend rate

> [!Note] Imagine a concave curve (facing away from the origin) with long term zero slope. 

 Benefit obligations and Periodic costs can be reduced by reducing all the three attributes mentioned above.
