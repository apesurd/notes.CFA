#portfolioManagement 

How close constrained active return are to unconstrained active return. 
Correlation between constrained and unconstrained portfolio; typically lies between -1 and 1. 

$$

TC = \rho(\mu_i / \sigma_i , \Delta w_i / \sigma_i)
$$
Where $\mu$ is the anticipate ex-ante return and $\Delta w$ is active weight.
