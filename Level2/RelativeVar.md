Estimate the Var of the return of the portfolio wrt to the benchmark. 
Portfolio is long and benchmark is short. Var is calculated on this combination. 

e.g. `5% daily RVaR is 0.25%` means 
5% of the time, the portfolio's relative underperformance in daily returns against the benchmark is at least 0.25%.
