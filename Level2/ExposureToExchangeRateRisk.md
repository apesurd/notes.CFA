In [[CurrentRateMethod]], only assets and liabilities are affected by [[CurrentRate_MA]]. 
- In general, total assets are higher than total liabilities for [[CurrentRateMethod]] therefore it has a Net Asset Exposure. Because of it, for every unit change in FX rate changes in assets would be higher than changes in liabilities. 
- Therefore: 
	- If FX rate $\uparrow$  : FX gain 
	- If FX rate $\downarrow$ : FX loss 

In [[TemporalMethod]], only monetary assets and liabilities are affected by [[CurrentRate_MA]], therefore to the exchange rate risk. 
- If total monetary liabilities are higher than total monetary assets, then the BS has Net Monetary Liability exposure, which would mean for each unit change in FX rate, changes in M. liabilities would be higher than changes in M. assets.
- therefore :
	- If FX rate $\uparrow$ : FX loss 
	- IF FX rate $\downarrow$ : FX gain

In case where monetary assets balances the monetary liabilities, there would be Net Zero Exposure. And the BS should remain unaffected by FX rate fluctuations. 
This, however, is not doable for [[CurrentRateMethod]], since balancing all the assets with liabilities is not healthy for a company.

>[!Tip] When local currency depreciates, it would reduce the FX rate too. In this chapter we refer to the FX rate as Presentation/Functional or Functional/Local.
