# Steps 
## 1. Identify Recent Takeovers 
- Same industry, size and capital structure. 
- Analyst might require to use discretion to collect companies which can be used in the estimation. 

## 2. Calculate Relative measures 
Similar to [[ComparableCompanyAnalysis]] , but instead of using share price we use the takeover price. 
Since takeover price already factors in the takeover premium, the value calculated this is considered the value of the target company stock. 

# Advantage 
1. No need to estimate takeover premium 
2. Estimates are derived directly from the market, rather than assumptions and estimates about the future which may be prone to errors. 
3. Take over prices has a reasonable basis of being in line with past takeovers. 

# Disadvantage 
1. Implicitly assumes that past transactions are priced reasonably. If past transactions were mispriced, then mispricings will be carried over. 
2. Not enough comparable transactions to develop a reliable data set. 
3. May be inaccurate because it is difficult to incorporate specific plans for the target.
