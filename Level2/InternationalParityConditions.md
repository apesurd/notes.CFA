International parity conditions form the building block of most models of exchange rate determination in long-term (empirical studies have found that the parity conditions rarely hold in the short term, they do help form a broadly based, long-term view of exchange rate and accompanying risk exposures.)

1. [[CoveredInterestRateParity]] (only parity condition that holds in the short-term as well)
2. [[UncoveredInterestRateParity]]
3. [[ForwardRateParity]]
4. [[PurchasingPowerParity]]
5. [[InternationalFisherEffect]]

> **How parity conditions are interrelated**
> 	 how expected inflation differentials, interest rate differentials, forward exchange rates, current spot rates, and expected future spot exchange rates would be linked in an ideal world.

> Assumptions: 
> 	- Zero transaction cost 
> 	- Perfect information that is available to all market participants 
> 	- Risk neutrality 
> 	- Freely adjustable market prices.
