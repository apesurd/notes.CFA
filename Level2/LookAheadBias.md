Manager at a certain point in history wouldn't have the information that he has today. 

Assume standard reporting lag of one month, but this might not always work as different form of data may be different reporting lag. 

If lag is too long, that run the risk of stale data. 

Another issue is related to vendors providing restating figures after accounting errors or change in accounting standards.
