#Economics 

- Bet against [[UncoveredInterestRateParity]]
- Invest in *higher yielding currency* using funds borrowed in a *lower yielding currency.*

> Return (%) = Interest earned - Funding cost + Appreciation in currency A vs B

> [!Note] Typically perform well during low volatility period.

## Risks
`Crash risk`: Price currency depreciates wrt the base currency, more than the differential in the interest rates in the respective countries.
- Very likely to happen in emerging market currencies.

## Return distribution of the carry trade
- High kurtosis
- Negatively skewed
