#Regression 

Effects of conditional heteroscadasticity and autocorrelation can be corrected using Robust Standard Errors.

**NOTE: There is no formula for it's calculation in CFA curriculum.** 

- Also known as 
	- heterscadasticity-consistent standard errors
	- White-corrected standard errors.
	- serial-correlation consitent standard errors
	- serial correlation and heteroscadasticity adjusted standard errors
	- Newey-west standard errors

They are larger than OLS standard errors and allow the regression model results to be used for statistical inference.

They use heteroscadasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators of the variance-covariance matrix in the regression estimation.
