#EquityInvestements 

- Type of present value model to calculate intrinsic value of the stock. See [[PresentValueModels]] 

- Majorly 2 types of cash-flows: 
	1. [[FCFF]] : Free Cash Flow to the Firm 
	2. [[FCFE]] : Free Cash Flow to the Equity 
	   - Cash flow that can be redeployed outside the company. 


## How to REMEMBER 
### FCFF
1. NI + NCC - $WC_{Inv}$  + Interest (1- T) - $FC_{Inv}$   
1. EBIT (1 - T)  + NCC - $WC_{Inv}$  - $FC_{Inv}$   
1. EBITDA (1 - T)  + Dep * T  -  $WC_{Inv}$  - $FC_{Inv}$   
2. CFO  + Interest (1- T) - $FC_{Inv}$

### FCFE 
FCFF - Interest (1-T) - Principal repayments + net borrowings


## Advantage 
1. Can be applied to the firms with no dividend history. 
	- FCFE is a good proxy for what the company can afford to pay out. 
2. Appropriate for investors with intent to take control. 

## Disadvantages 
- For startups, rapid growth companies cash flow can be negative, which would make it less reliable estimate of value.
