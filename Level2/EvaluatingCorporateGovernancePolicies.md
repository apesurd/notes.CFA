#issCorp #ESGConsiderations 

Inefficient corporate governance can lead to: 
1. Damaged reputation 
2. Lack of market competitiveness 
3. Low/volatile stock price 
4. Higher borrowing cost 
5. Decreased profitability 
6. Shareholder activism 

Key factors to consider: 
## Board policies and practices 
1. Board structure: 
	   - Should be accountable to shareholders 
		   - Oversight and representation 
	   - CEO duality is red flag
2. Board Independence 
3. Board composition: Must be diverse 
4. Skills and experience: should have experience in the industry while having the expertise in board member role. 
5. Board tenure: two edged sword
6. Board committees: Set up **independent** committees for different functions 
	   1. Audit committee 
	   2. Compensation committee 
	   3. Nomination committee 
	   4. Risk committee 
	   5. Investment committee 
	   6. Governance committee 
7. How the board performs duties 
8. Board leadership
9. Interaction with management 
10. Culture 

Evaluation should be presented to external shareholders and regulators. 
## Executive compensation 
- CEO Pay / Average worker pay
- Globally the ratio has been increasing 
- compensation higher than the industry average require an examination 
- Should be transparent. 
- Does it provide appropriate incentive to the drive the company value 
	- KPI are useful measure for incentive mechanism 
- [[ClawbackPolicy]]
- "Say-on-pay" Provision: shareholders vote on renumeration issues for management  

## Shareholder Voting rights
- **Straight Voting**: Equal voting rights. 
	  - When minority shareholders own higher proportion of shares then any majority shareholder, then they can theoretically outvote him/her. 
- **Dual Class Shares**: Founders/Managers may have more voting power than minority share holders. Can lead to conflict of interest.
