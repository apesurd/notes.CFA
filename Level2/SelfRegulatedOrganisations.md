#Economics 

A distinct class of SRB with key distinction that it is recognised by the government and given enforcement powers.

- They are funded by the members and represent the members. 

But since they are recognised by the government, they also fall within the category of independent regulators.

e.g. FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) is authorised by SEC to enforce security laws and regulations.

The use of SROs is only common in common law countries, such as US and Uk. 
- Common law countries rely more on self-regulation

---
In CIVIL Law countries, Govt. Agencies fulfil the roles of SROs. 
Non-independent SRBs support regulatory framework via guidelines, codes of conduct, and continuing education.
