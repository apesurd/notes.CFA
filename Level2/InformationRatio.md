#portfolioManagement 

Provides risk-adjusted active return. 

(Avg [[ActiveReturn]] )/ [[ActiveRisk]]

Can be used to measure both [[ExPost]] and [[ExAnte]] performance. 

- Unlike [[SharpeRatio]], addition of risk free assets and leverage would affect the value of information ratio. 

- Combination of $R_p$ and $R_B$ portfolios lie on the curve as shown in the plot below. 
- There is a point on this curve with highest sharpe ratio, which coincide with [[OptimalActiveRisk]]
