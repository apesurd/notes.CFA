- Bonds of any maturity are perfect substitutes of one another.

- Investors are risk neutral as per this theory
- Every security is risk free and yields the risk-free rate for any particular period. 



- Forward rates are unbiased predictors of future spot rates.
- If expect future spot rates to be lower, then the yield curve would be downward sloping 
- If expect future spot rates to be higher, then the yield curve would be upward sloping.
- If expect future spot rates to be the same, then the yield curve would be parallel to the x-axis.
