# Steps:
## 1. Identify Comparable Companies
 - Ideally should be from same industry, and have same size and capital structure. 
 - Set should be as large as possible 
 - If there are insufficient comparable companies in the same industry, companies from the similar industry can be included. 

## 2. Calculate Relative Value Measures 
1. Price multiples : P/E, P/B, P/CF, P/S, etc.
2. Enterprise value multiples : EV/FCF, EV/EBITDA, EV/S, etc.
3. Industry specific ratios: Price/barrel for O&G industry.

Using the multiples, we calculate a tentative share price of the target. 
## 3. Determine and apply [[TakeoverPremium]]
Can be determined by taking into consideration the stock-price before and after the recent takeovers of similar companies.  

# Advantages 
1. Provides reasonable approximation of a target's value relative to similar companies. **Fundamentally sound.**
2. Data for comparable companies is easy to access. 
3. Estimates are derived directly from the market, rather than assumptions and estimates about the future which may be prone to errors. 

# Disadvantages 
1. Implicitly assumes that the market's valuation of comparable companies is accurate. (Markets are prone to mispricing.)
2. Additional step of determining takeover premium is required which may be problematic as the past takeover data may not be timely or accurate. 
3. May be inaccurate because it is difficult to incorporate specific plans for the target (i.e. changing capital structure, cost savings, etc.)
